1.Arabic students. 阿拉伯学生  

Arab students will be able to sign up to study at a 【distance】 for the business courses in their own language. The Edinburgh Business School 【announced】 the project at a 【reception】 in Cairo on Saturday. It is hoped the course will improve links between the university and the Arab business world. A university spokeswoman said: The Arabic MBA will 【raise】 the profile of Heriot Watt University and the Edinburgh Business School among businesses in the Arabic-speaking world and will create a strong 【network】 of graduates in the 【region】. The first 【intake】 of students is expected later this year. Professor Keith Lumsden, director of Edinburgh Business School, said: Arabic is a major global language and the Arab world is a centre for business and industrial development. We are proud to work with Arab International Education to meet the demands of the region.

2.Mount Everest. 珠穆朗玛峰  

Called Chomolungma, goddess mother of the world, in Tibet and Sagarmatha, goddess of the sky, in Nepal. Mount Everest once went by the pedestrian name Peak XV among Westerners. That was before 【surveyors】 established that it was the highest mountain on Earth, a fact that cames something of a surprise, Peak XV had seemed lost in the crowd of other formidable Himalayan peaks, many of which gave the 【illusion】 of greater height.
In 1852 the Great Trigonometrically Survey of India measured Everest's elevation as 29,002 feet above sea level. This figure remained the officially 【accepted】 height for more than one hundred years. In 1955 it was adjusted by a mere 26 feet to 29,028.
The mountain received its official name in 1865 in honour of Sir George Everest, the British Surveyor General from 1830 to 1843 who had mapped the India subcontinent. He had some 【reservations】 about having his name bestowed on the peak, arguing that the mountain should retain its local appellation, the standard policy of geographical societies.
Before the Survey of India, a number of the other mountains ranked supreme in the eyes of the world. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the Andean peak Chimborazo was considered the highest. At a relatively unremarkable 20,561 feet. it is in fact nowhere near the highest, 【surpassed】 by about thirty other Andean peaks and several dozens in the Himalayas. In 1809, the Himalayan peak Dhaulagiri was declared the ultimate, only to be shunted aside in 1840 by Kanchenjunga , which today ranks third. Everest's status has been unrivalled for the last century and a half, but not without a few threats.

3.Richard Morris. 理查德·莫里斯  

Richard Morris, of the school of accounting at the University of NSW, which requires an entrance score in the top 5 percent of students, says attendance has been a problem since the late 1990s.
"Sometimes in the lectures we've only got about one-third of students 【enrolled】 attending," he said.
"It definitely is a problem. If you don't turn up to class you're missing out on the whole richness of the 【experience】: you don't think a whole lot, you don't 【engage】 in debates with other students, or with your teachers."
It is not all gloom, said Professor John Dearn, a Province-Chancellor at the University of Canberra, who said the Internet was 【transforming】 the way students access and use information.
"It is strange that despite all the evidence as to their ineffectiveness, 【traditional】 lecture seems to persist in our universities."

4.Foreign students' English standards. 留学生的英语水平  

Federal Education Minister Julie Bishop says she has seen no 【evidence】 that international students are graduating from Australian universities with poor English skills. Research by Monash University academic Bob Birrell has found a third of international students are graduating 【without】 a competent level of English. But Ms. Bishop says Australian universities only enrol international students once they have achieved international standards of language 【proficiency】."This has been an extraordinary attack by Professor Birrell on our universities," she said."International students must meet international 【benchmarks】 in the English language in order to get a place at a university in Australia, and they can't get into university without reaching that international standard."
University of Canberra vice-chancellor Roger Dean also says international students are required to sit an English test before being admitted to nearly all Australian universities."There are, of course, intercultural difficulties as well as language difficulties," he said."There are, of course, also many Australian students who don't speak such 【fantastically】 good English either.""So we're trying to push the standard even higher than a present, but it's a very useful one already."
Ms. Bishop says Australia's university system has high standards."I've seen no evidence to suggest that students are not able to complete their courses because they're failing in English yet they're being passed by the universities," she said."I've not seen any evidence to back that up."
"International education is one of our largest exports, it's our fourth largest export, and it's in the interest of our universities to maintain very high standards because their 【reputation】 is 【at stake】."

5.Plants & Animals band. 植物与动物乐队  

Plants and Animals are a Montreal-based indie rock 【trio】 that began playing together as kids. Touring 【arduously】 for about five years after their proper full-length debut in 2008, they pretty much made their records on the go until 2013. So the band's decision to be slow, deliberate, and thorough on their latest offering Waltzed In From The Rumbling, represents a major change of pace. Finally sleeping in there in own beds while recording, the band assembled the album over the course of nine seasons. It's a return to their origins, but it also pushes audaciously forward.
The 【aesthetic】 varies wildly and wonderfully from track to track, each song having its own hermetic seal but somehow still melding 【cohesively】 as a body of work. Jangling guitars, drums leaning toward the off-kilter swing of J Dilla, found sounds, a hint of shoegaze, and unorthodox instrumentation come together to keep the ear constantly 【engaged】 with a feeling of constant evolution. They found an antique guiro next to broken VCR and recorded both. They made an empty fridge sound like a timpani drum. They recorded gossip on a city bus. They brought in classical string flourishes. They sometimes left mistakes if they felt they were perfectly imperfect. It's truly DIY, but with a feel of big production value that makes the album soar.
Contemplative lyrics anchor the album through all the exploratory 【wandering】. The words are delivered melodically, belying their potency, but listening beyond the pretty aesthetic reveals piercing observations and an undeniable translation of feeling. The simplicity of the penetrating refrain on the three-part mini-opus"Je Voulais Te Dire" is a paragon of how the lyrics effortlessly cut through the instrumentation. Guitarist or vocalist Warren Spicer sings"It's only loving, but you want it bad." encompassing how we try to avoid and downplay our desire for love and affection, but ultimately search and long for it anyway.

6.Wolf. 狼  

From the wolf's perspective, this is clearly good news. But it also had beneficial effects on the ecology of the park, according to a study published in 2004 by William Ripple and Robert Beschta from Oregon State University. In their paper in BioScience, the two researchers showed that 【reintroducing】 the wolves was 【correlated】 with the increased growth of willow and cottonwood in the park. Why? Because grazing animals such as elk were 【avoiding】 sites from which they couldn't easily escape, the scientists 【claimed】. And as the woody plants and trees grew taller and thicker, beaver 【colonies】 expanded.

7.Roman Arena. 罗马竞技场  

The Romans glorified the 【bravery】 shown in the arena, but 【trivialised】 the events and degraded the participants. Mosaic pictures of executions and combats, 【graphically】 violent to our eyes, were displayed in the public rooms and even dining rooms in the homes of wealthy Romans. How can the viewer today possibly understand such images? Until fairly recently, modern authors writing about the arena minimised its significance and 【represented】 the institutionalised violence as a sideline to Roman history. The 【tendency】 was also to view the events through our own eyes and to see them as pitiful or horrifying, although to most Romans empathy with victims of the arena was inconceivable. In the past few decades, however, scholars have started to analyse the complex motivations for deadly public entertainments and for contradictory views of gladiators as despised, yet beloved hero- slaves.

8.Estee Lauder. 雅诗兰黛  

She transformed beauty into big business by cultivating classy sales methods and giving away samples.
Leonard Lauder, chief executive of the company his mother founded, says she always thought she"was growing a mice little business." And that it is. A little business that 【controls】 45 percent of the cosmetics market in U.S. department stores. A little business that sells in 118 countries and last year grew to be 3.6 billion big in sales. The Lauder family's shares are worth more than 6 billion.
But early on, there wasn't a burgeoning business; there weren't houses in New York. Palm Beach, Fla., or the south of France. It is said that at one point there was one person to answer the telephones who 【changed】 her voice to become the shipping or billing department as needed.
You more or less know the Estee Lauder story because it's a chapter from the book of American business folklore. In short, Josephine Esther Mentzer, daughter of immigrants, lived above her father's hardware store in Corona, a section of Queens in New York City. She started her 【enterprise】 by selling skin creams concocted by her uncle, a chemist, in beauty shops, beach clubs and resorts.
No doubt the potions were good, Estee Lauder was a quality fanatic, but the sales lady was better. Much better. And she simply outworked everyone else in the cosmetics industry. She 【stalked】 the bosses of New York City department stores until she got some counter space at Saks Fifth Avenue in 1948. And once in that space, she utilised a personal selling approach that proved as 【potent】 as the promise of her skin regimens and perfumes.

9.Wine and ale. 葡萄酒与麦芽酒  

By the Bronze Age, drinking 【vessels】 were being made of sheet metal, primarily bronze or gold. However, the peak of feasting, and in particular, of the' political' type of feast, came in the late Hallstatt period, about 600 to 450 BC, soon after the foundation of the Greek 【colony】 of Massalia at the mouth of the Rhine. From that date on, the blood of the grape began to make its way north and east along major river systems together with imported metal and ceramic drinking vessels from the Greek world.
The wine was thus added to the list of mood-altering beverages, such as mead and ale, available to establish social networks in Iron Age Europe. Attic pottery fragments found at hill forts such as Heuneburg in Germany and 【luxury】 goods such as the monumental 5th century Greek bronze krater, or wine-mixing vessel, found at Vix in Burgundy supply archaeological evidence of this interaction. Organic 【containers】 such as leather or wooden wine barrels may also have travelled north into Europe but have not survived It is unknown what goods were 【traded】 in return, but they may have included salted meat, hides, timber, amber, and slaves.

10.Smallpox. 天花  

According to the literature, the history of vaccination can be traced back to as early as the 7th century when the monks in India tried to immunise themselves by drinking snake 【venom】. The first vaccination was inoculation with human smallpox, a practise widely carried out in ancient India, Arabia, and China. This method of vaccination consisted of collecting pus from a patient suffering from a 【mild】 form of smallpox virus infection and 【inoculating】 the sample to a healthy human, which later led to a minor infection. This method was first introduced in England by a Greek named E. Timoni. However, this method had a risk of spreading smallpox in the community and even worsening the health condition of the person who received the inoculation. While the use of human smallpox vaccine was 【controversial】, E. Jenner came up with bovine smallpox vaccine in 1796; this new method also faced controversy but continued to be 【universalized】. Smallpox became a preventable disease by injecting pus extracted from a human infected with cowpox virus. Jenner named the substance"vaccine" after the Latin word"Vacca" which means"cow," and thus the process of giving vaccine became"vaccination."

11.Ocean floor. 海底  

The ocean floor is home to many unique communities of plants and animals. Most of these marine ecosystems are near the water surface, such as the Great Barrier Reef, 12,000-km-long coral 【formation】 off the northeastern coast of Australia. Coral reefs, like nearly all-complex living communities, depend on solar energy for growth. The sun's energy, however, penetrates at most only about 300m below the surface of the water. The relatively shallow penetration of solar energy and the sinking of cold, subpolar water combine to make most of the deep ocean floor a 【frigid】 environment with few life forms.
In 1977, scientists discovered hot spring at a depth of 2.5 km, on the Galapagos Rift, spreading ridge, off the coast of Ecuador. This exciting discovery was not really a 【surprise】. Since the early 1970s, scientists had predicted that hot springs, geothermal vents, should be found at the active spreading centres along the mid-oceanic ridges, where magma, at temperatures over 1,000 C, presumably was being erupted to form a new oceanic crust. More exciting, because it was totally 【unexpected】, was the discovery of abundant and unusual sea life-giant tube worms, huge clams, and mussels, that 【thrived】 around the hot springs.

12.Burger King. 汉堡王  

Drive down any highway, and you'll see a proliferation of chain restaurants, most likely, if you travel long and far enough, you'll see McDonald's golden arches as well as signs for Burger King, Hardee's and Wendy's the"big four" of burgers. Despite its name, though. Burger King has fallen short of 【claiming】 the burger crown, unable to surpass market leader MacDonald's No.1 sales status. Always the bridesmaid and never the bride, Burger King remains No.2.
Worse yet, Burger King has experienced a six-year 22 percent decline in customer traffic, with its overall quality rating dropping while ratings for the other three 【contenders】 have increased. The decline has been 【attributed】 to inconsistent product quality and poor customer service. Although the chain tends to throw advertising dollars at the problem, an understanding of Integrated Marketing Communications theory would suggest that internal management problems, nineteen CEOs in fifty years, need to be 【rectified】 before a unified, long-term strategy can be put in place.
The 【importance】 of consistency in brand image and messages, not at all levels of communication, has become a basic tenet of IMC theory and practise. The person who takes the customer's order must communicate the same message a Burger King's famous tagline,"have it your way" or the customer will just buzz up the highway to a chain restaurant that seems more consistent and, therefore, more 【reliable】.

13.William Shakespeare. 威廉·莎士比亚  

For all his fame and celebration, William Shakespeare remains a 【mysterious】 figure with regards to personal history. There are just two primary 【sources】 for information on the Bard: his works, and various legal and 【church】 documents that have survived from Elizabethan times. Naturally, there are many 【gaps】 in this body of information, which tells us little about Shakespeare, the man.

14.Lure New Students. 吸引新生  

In an attempt to 【lure】 new students, leading business schools, including Harvard, Stanford, the University of Chicago and Wharton, have moved away from the unofficial missions and 【prerequisite】 of four years' work experience and 【instead】 have set their sights on recent college graduates and so-called"early career" 【professionals】 with only a couple years of work under their belt.

15.Market for Vegetarian foods. 素食食品市场  

Mintel Consumer Intelligence 【estimates】 the 2002 market for vegetarian foods, those that directly replace meat or other animal products, to be 1.5 billion. Note that this excludes traditional vegetarian foods such as produce, pasta, and rice. Mintel forecasts the market to nearly double by 2006 to 2.8 billion, with the highest growth coming from soymilk, especially refrigerated brands.
The Food and Drug Administration's 1999 decision to allow manufacturers to include heart-healthy claims on foods that deliver at least 6.25 grammes of soy protein per serving and are also low in 【saturated】 fat and cholesterol has spurred 【tremendous】 interest in soymilk and other soy foods. A representative of manufacturer Food Tech International, Veggie Patch brand, reported that from 1998 to 1999, the percentage of consumers willing to try soy products jumped from 32 percent to 67 percent. Beliefs about soy's 【effectiveness】 in reducing the symptoms of menopause also attracted new consumers. A 2000 survey conducted by the United Soybean Board showed that the number of people eating soy products once a week or more was up to 27 percent. Forty-five percent of respondents had tried tofu, 41 percent had sampled veggie burgers, and 25 percent had experience with soymilk, Soyfoods USA e-mail newsletter. Mintel estimates 2001 sales of frozen and refrigerated meat 【alternatives】 in food stores at nearly 300 million, with soymilk sales nearing 250 million.

16.Indian Onion. 印度洋葱  

The most 【vital】 ingredient in Indian cooking, the 【basic】 element with which all dishes begin and, normally, the cheapest vegetable available, the pink onion is an essential item in the shopping basket of families of all classes.
A popular saying holds that you will never starve because you can always afford a roti, a piece of simple, flatbread, and an onion.
But in recent weeks, the onion has started to seem an unaffordable 【luxury】 for India's poor. Over the past few days, another sharp 【surge】 in prices has begun to unsettle the influential urban middle classes.
The sudden spike in prices has been caused by large exports to neighbouring countries and a shortage of 【supply】.
With its capacity for bringing down governments and scarring political careers, the onion plays an 【explosive】 role in Indian politics. This week, reports of rising onion prices have made front-page news and absorbed the attention of the governing elite.

17.Edison. 爱迪生  

Like Ben Franklin, Thomas Alva Edison was 【both】 a scientist and an inventor. Born in 1847, Edison would see 【tremendous】 change take place in his lifetime. He was also to be responsible for making many of those changes occur. When Edison was born, society still thought of electricity as a 【novelty】, a fad. By the time he died, entire cities were lit by electricity. Much of the credit for that progress goes to Edison. In his lifetime, Edison patented 1,093 inventions, earning him the nickname"The Wizard of Menlo Park" The most famous of his inventions was the incandescent light bulb. Besides the light bulb, Edison developed the phonograph and the"kinetoscope," a small box for viewing moving films. He also 【improved】 upon the original design of the stock ticker, the telegraph, and Alexander Graham Bell's telephone. He believed in hard work, sometimes working twenty hours a day. Edison was quoted as saying,"Genius is one percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration." In 【tribute】 to this important American, electric lights in the United States were dimmed for one minute on October 21, 1931, a few days after his death.

18.United Nations. 联合国  

Founded after World War the second by 51' peace-loving states' combined to oppose future aggression, the United Nations now counts 192 member nations, 【including】 its newest member, Nauru, Kiribati, and Tonga in 1999, Tuvalu and Yugoslavia in 2000, Switzerland and East Timor in 2002, and Montenegro in 2006.
United Nations Day has been 【observed】 on October 24th since 1948 and celebrates the objectives and accomplishments of the organisation, which was established on October 24th, 1945.
The UN 【engages】 in peacekeeping and humanitarian missions conflict 【prevention】 across the globe. Though some say its 【influence】 has declined in recent decades, the United Nations still plays a tremendous role in world politics. In 2001 the United Nations and Kofi Annan, then Secretary-General of the UN, won the Nobel Peace Prize' for their work for a better organised and more peaceful world.'
Since 1948 there have been 63 UN peacekeeping operations 16 are currently underway. Thus far, close to 130 nations have contributed personnel at various times; 119 are currently providing peacekeepers. As of August 31, 2008, there were 16 peacekeeping operations underway with a total of 88,230 personnel. The small island nation of Fiji has taken part in virtually every UN peacekeeping operation, as has Canada.

19.English class. 英语课  

There were twenty-six freshmen 【majoring】 in English at Beijing Language Institute in the class of 1983, and I was assigned to Group Two with another eleven boys and girls who had come from big cities in China. I was 【told】 that language study required smallness so that we would get more attention from the skillful teachers. The better the school, the smaller the class.
I realised that my classmates were already all 【talking】 in English, simple sentences tossed out to each other in their red-faced introductions and carefree chatting. Their intonations were curving and dramatic and their pronunciation refined and accurate. But as I stretched to catch the drips and drops of their humming dialogue, I couldn't 【understand】 it all, only that it was English. Those words now flying before me sounded a little familiar. I had read them and tried to speak them, but I had never heard them 【spoken】 back to me in such a speedy, fluent manner. My big plan of 【beating】 the city folks was thawing before my eyes.

20.Kimbell. 金贝尔（美术馆）  

The first section of the book covers new modes of assessment. In Chapter 1, Kimbell, Goldsmith College, London responds to 【criticisms】 of design programmes as formalistic and conventional, stating that a focus on risk-taking than hard work in design innovation is equally problematic. His research contains three parts that include preliminary exploration of design innovation qualities, investigation of resulting classroom practises, and development of the evidence-based assessment. The assessment he describes is presented in the form of a structured worksheet, which includes a 【collaborative】 【element】 and digital photographs, in story format. Such a device encourages stimulating ideas but does not recognise students as design 【innovators】. The assessment sheet includes holistic impressions as well as details about"having, growing, and proving" ideas. 【Colloquial】 judgements are evident in terms such as"wow" and"yawn" and reward the quality and quantity of ideas with the term,"sparkiness," which fittingly is a pun as the model project was to design light bulb packaging. In addition, the assessment focuses on the process of optimising or complexity control as well as proving ideas with thoughtful criticism and not just generation of novel ideas. The definitions for qualities such as"technical" and"aesthetic" pertaining to users are too narrow and ill-defined. The author provides 【examples】 of the project, its features and structures, students' notes and judgements, and their sketches and photographs of finished light bulb packages, in the Appendix.

21.Jean Piaget. 让·皮亚杰  

Jean Piaget, the pioneering Swiss philosopher, and psychologist spent much of his professional life listening to children, watching children and 【poring】 over reports of researchers around the world who were doing the same. He found, to put most 【succinctly】, that children don't think like grownups. After thousands of interactions with young people often barely old enough to talk, Piaget began to 【suspect】 that behind their cute and seemingly illogical utterances were thought processes that had their own kind of order and their own special logic. Einstein called it a 【discovery】"so simple that only a genius could have thought of it."
Piaget's insight opened a new window into the inner workings of the mind. By the end of a wide-ranging and remarkably 【prolific】 research career that spanned nearly 75 years, from his first scientific publication at age 10 to work still in progress when he died at 84, Piaget had developed several new fields of science: developmental psychology, cognitive theory and what came to be called genetic epistemology. Although not an educational reformer, he 【fashioned】 a way of thinking about children that provided the foundation for today's education-reform 【movements】. It was a shift comparable to the displacement of stories of"noble savages" and"cannibals" by modern anthropology. One might say that Piaget was the first to take children's thinking seriously.

22.Eiffel. 埃菲尔（铁塔）  

The Eiffel Tower was the tallest building in the world when it was completed in 1889. It was built for the World's Fair to 【demonstrate】 that iron could be as strong as a stone while being infinitely lighter. And in fact, the wrought-iron tower is twice as tall as the masonry Washington Monument, and yet it weighs 70,000 tonnes less! It is repainted every seven years with 50 tonnes of dark brown paint.
Called"the father of the skyscraper," the Home Insurance Building, 【constructed】 in Chicago in 1885, and demolished in 1931 , was 138 feet tall and ten stories. It was the first building to effectively employ a supporting 【skeleton】 of steel beams and columns, allowing it to have many more windows than traditional masonry structures. But this new construction method made people worry that the building would fall down, leading the city to halt construction until they could 【investigate】 the structure's safety.
In 1929, auto tycoon Walter Chrysler took part in an intense race with the Bank of Manhattan Trust Company to build the world's tallest skyscraper. Just when it looked like the bank had captured the 【coveted】 title, workers at the Chrysler Building jacked a thin spire hidden inside the building through the top of the roof to win the contest, subsequently losing the title four months later to the Empire State Building. Chrysler also decorated his building to mirror his cars, with hubcaps, mudguards, and hood ornaments.

23.Seatbelt. 安全带  

I am a cyclist and a motorist. I fasten my seatbelt when I drive and wear a helmet on my bike to reduce the risk of injury. I am convinced that these are 【prudent】 safety measures. I have persuaded many friends to wear helmets on the grounds that transplant surgeons call those without helmets,"donors on wheels". But a book on' Risk' by my colleague John Adams has made me re- examine my 【convictions】. Adams has completely 【undermined】 my confidence in these apparently sensible precautions. What he has persuasively argued, particularly in relation to seat belts, is that the evidence that they do what they are supposed to do is very suspect. This is 【in spite】 of numerous claims that seat belts save many thousands of lives every year. Between 1970 and 1978 countries in which the wearing of seat belts is 【compulsory】 had on average about five percent more road accident death than before the introduction of law. In the United Kingdom road deaths decreased steadily about seven thousand a year in.

24.Definition of Country. 国家的定义  

What is a country, and how is a country defined? When people ask how many countries there are in the world, they expect a simple answer. After all, we've explored the 【whole】 planet; we have international travel, satellite navigation and plenty of global organisations like the United Nations, 【so】 we should really know how many countries there are! However, the answer to the question varies according to whom you ask. 【most】 people say there are 192 countries, but others point out that there could be more like 260 of them. So why isn't there a straightforward answer? The problem 【arises】 because there isn't a universally agreed definition of' country' and because, for political reasons, some countries 【find】 it convenient to recognise or not recognise 【other】 countries.

25.National Sustainable Development Strategies. 国家可持续发展战略  

The principal recommendation of the world conferences was that countries must take full responsibility for their own development. National responsibility for national development is the necessary consequence of 【sovereignty】. The Monterrey Consensus states that' Each country has primary responsibility for its own economic and social development, and the role of national policies and development strategies cannot be 【over-emphasized】. The Johannesburg Plan of 【Implementation】 called for all governments to begin implementing national sustainable development strategies, NSDS, by 2005 and the 2005 Summit agreed on a target to achieve the internationally agreed goals. The automatic 【corollary】 of that principle is that each country must be free to determine its own development strategy. It is essential that all donors and lenders accept the principle of country ownership of national development strategies. This implies the acceptance of the principle that development strategies should not only be 【attuned】 to country circumstances but also be prepared and implemented under the leadership of the governments of the countries themselves, The 2005 World Summit also acknowledge, in this regard, that all countries must recognise the need for developing countries to strike a 【balance】 between their national policy priorities and their international commitments.

26.Australian Overseas Departures. 澳大利亚出境人数  

Over the past ten years, Australian overseas departures have grown from 1.7 million to 3.2 million. This represents the strong average, annual growth of 6.5 percent. This paper 【analyses】 outbound travel demand to each destination country using the travel demand models of short-term resident departures. The models are specified in terms of a double logarithmic linear functional form, with overseas departures as the dependent variable and real household disposable income prices of travel and accommodation in Australia, and overseas and the exchange rate as independent 【variables】.
The models were estimated using historical time series data from 1973 to 1998. The data were obtained from several 【sources】 such as the World Tourism Organization, Australian Bureau of Statistics, World Bank and International Monetary Fund. The results suggest that the estimated elasticity parameters are consistent with standard economic theory. The number of short-term resident departures are positively influenced by per capita real household disposable income; and the price of domestic travel and accommodation are 【negatively】 influenced by the price of travel and accommodation overseas.
The estimated demand models were used to develop the Tourism Forecasting Council's long-run forecasts. The forecasts suggest that the number of short-term resident departures will increase strongly over the next ten years, largely due to the strength of the Australian economy, competitive trove prices, and Australians' interests in 【experiencing】 different cultures and lifestyles.

27.Late payment. 逾期付款  

There isn't a financial director around who wouldn't like to 【accelerate】 cash flow by reducing debtor days, in other words, get customers to pay up faster. In Europe's top 1, 000 quoted companies, nearly one-quarter of all invoices are unpaid at any 【point】 in time, according to recent research carried out by the ASF organisation. This means they are sitting on a total of 274bn overdue debt. Most of this is caused by poor collection practises. According to Jan Porter, ASF's Managing Director," You can set up all the systems you want, you can insist on 【watertight】 contracts and payment terms, the government can even introduce late payment legislation, but there are always some debtors who 【fail】 to pay on time. Once payment is overdue, your first step is to talk to your debtor. You should let them know the payment is late and try to find out if there is a dispute about the work, or if your debtor has financial problems. This is OK, but Tim Vainio, a chartered accountant, believes that too many companies are afraid of losing a relationship, and that, before 【undertaking】 any action, the focus should be in recovering as much money as possible, rather than on preserving a relationship.

28.Father's books. 父亲的书籍  

None of the books in my father's dusty old bookcase were 【forbidden】. Yet while I was growing up, I never saw anyone take one down. Most were 【massive】 tomes, a comprehensive history of civilization, matching volumes of the great works of western literature, numerous others I can no longer 【recall】- that seemed almost fused to 【shelves】 that bowed slightly from decades of 【steadfast】 support.

29.Folklore. 民俗  

Folklore, a modern term for the 【body】 of traditional customs, superstitions, stories, dances, and songs that have been adopted and maintained within a given 【community】 by processes of repetition is not reliant on the written word. Along with folk songs and folktales, this broad 【category】 of cultural forms embraces all kinds of legends, riddles, jokes, proverbs, games, charms, omens, spells, and rituals, especially those of pre-literate societies or social classes. Those forms of verbal expression that are handed on from one generation or locality to the next by 【word】 of the mouth are said to constitute an oral 【tradition】.

30.Outer space. 外太空  

Researchers already know that spending long periods of time in a zero-gravity 【environment】, such as that inside the International Space Station, ISS, result in loss of bone density and 【damage】 to the body's 【muscles】. That's partly why stays aboard the ISS are 【restricted】 at six months. And now, a number of NASA astronauts are reporting that their 20 or 30 【vision】 【deteriorated】 after spending time in space, with many needing glasses once they returned to Earth.

31.Oxford medical school. 牛津医学院  

When I enroled in my master's course at Oxford last year, I had come straight from medical school with the decision to leave clinical science for good. Thinking back, I realise that I didn't put very much 【weight】 on this decision at the time. But today, I more clearly understand the 【consequences】 of leaving my original profession. When I meet old friends who are now physicians and surgeons, I sense how our views on medical problems have 【diverged】. They scrutinise the effects of disease and try to eliminate or alleviate them; I try to understand how they come about in the first place. I feel happier working on this side of the problem, although I do occasionally miss clinical work and seeing patients.
However, when I think about the rate at which my medical skills and knowledge have 【dissipated】, the years spent reading weighty medical textbooks, the hours spent at the bedside, I sometimes wonder if these years were partly a 【waste】 of time now that I am pursuing a research career.
Nonetheless, I know the value of my medical education. It is easy to forget the importance of the biosciences when working with model organisms in basic research that seem to have nothing to do with a sick child or a suffering elderly person. Yet, I still have vivid memories of the cruel kaleidoscope of severe diseases and of how they can 【strike】 a human being. I hope to retain these memories as a guide in my current occupation.

32.Movement in painting. 绘画中的运动表现  

Movement in painting that 【originated】 in France in the 1860s and had enormous influence in European and North American painting in the late 19th century. The Impressionists wanted to 【depict】 real life, to paint straight from nature, and to capture the changing effects of light. The term was first used abusively to describe Claude Monet's painting Impression: Sunrise. The other leading Impressionists included Paul Camile, Edger Degas, Edouard, Manet, Camille Pissarro, Pierre Auguste Renoir, and Alfred Sisley, but only Monet remained devoted to Impressionist ideas throughout his career.
The core of the Impressionist group was formed in the early 1860s by Monet, Renoir, and Sisley, who met as students and enjoyed painting in the open air, one of the hallmarks of Impressionism. They met other members of the Impressionist circle through Paris cafe society. They never made up a formal group, but they organised eight group exhibitions between 1874 and 1886, at the first of which the name Impressionism was applied. Their styles were diverse, but all 【experimented】 with effects of light and movement created with distinct brush strokes and 【fragments】 of colour dabbed side-by-side on the canvas rather than mixed on the palette. By the 1880s the movement's central impulse had dispersed, and a number of new styles were emerging, later described as post-impressionism.
British Impressionism had a major influence on the more 【experimental】 and progressive British painters in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Many of the painters were affected in the circle of Walter Sickert, who spent much of his career in France and was an influential figure who 【inspired】 many younger artists. His friend and exact contemporary Philip Wilson Steer is generally regarded as the most outstanding British Impressionist.

33.Locust. 蝗虫  

Fancy a locust for lunch? Probably not, if you live in the west, but elsewhere it's a different story. Edible insects, termites, stick insects, dragonflies, grasshoppers and giant water bugs, are on the menu for an 【estimated】 80 percent of the world's population.
More than 1000 species of insects are 【served】 up around the world. For example,"Kungu cakes", made from midges, are a 【delicacy】 in parts of Africa. Mexico is an insect-eating- or entomophagous-hotspot, where more than 200 insect species are consumed. 【Demand】 is so high that 40 species are now under 【threat】, including white agave worms. These caterpillars of the tequila giant-skipper butterfly 【fetch】 around 250 a kilogramme.
Eating insects make nutritional sense. Some contain more protein than meat or fish. The female gypsy moth, for instance, is about 80 percent protein. Insects can be a good 【source】 of vitamins and minerals too: a type of caterpillar, Usta Terpsichore, eaten in Angola is rich in iron, zinc, and thiamine. What do they taste like? Ants have a lemon tang, apparently, whereas giant water bugs taste of mint and fire ant pupae of watermelon. You have probably, inadvertently, already tasted some of these things, as insects are often accidental tourists in other types of food. The US Food and Drug Administration even issues guidelines for the number of insect parts allowed in certain foods. For example, it is 【acceptable】 for 225 grammes of macaroni to contain up to 225 insect fragments.

34.Visual art. 视觉艺术  

It is the assertion of this article that students who use visual art as a prewriting stimulus are composing their ideas both in images and in words. The result of the art creation process allows students the distance to 【elaborate】, add details, and create more coherent text. The process of writing is more than putting words on a piece of paper. Effective authors are able to create 【imagery】 and to communicate ideas using well-chosen words, phrases, and text structures. Emergent writers struggle with the 【mechanics】 of the writing process, i. e., fine motor control for printing legibly, recall of spelling patterns, and the use of syntax and grammar rules. As a result, texts written by young writers tend to be simplistic and formulaic. The artwork 【facilitates】 the writing process, resulting in a text that is richer in sensory detail and more 【intricate】 than the more traditional writing-first crayon drawing-second approach.

35.Morality of the welfare system. 福利制度的道德性  

The morality of the welfare state depends on contribution and responsibility. Since some people don't contribute and many are irresponsible, the choices of those who do contribute and are responsible are either to 【tolerate】 the free riders, refuse to pay for the 【effects】 of their irresponsibility or trust the state to 【educate】 them.

36.The horned desert viper. 角蝰蛇  

The horned desert viper's ability to hunt at night always has puzzled biologists. Though it lies with its 【head】 buried in the sand, it can strike with great precision as soon as prey appears. Now, Young and physicists Leo van Hemmen and Paul Friedel at the Technical University of Munich in Germany have developed a computer model of the snake's auditory 【system】 to explain how the snake"hears" its prey without really having the ears for it. Although the vipers have 【internal】 ears that can hear 【frequencies】 between 200 and 1,000 hertz, it is not the sound of the mouse scurrying about that they are detecting."The snakes don't have external 【eardrums】," says van Hemmen."So unless the mouse wears boots and starts stamping, the snake won't hear it."

37.Transitions. 过渡  

The school-to-work transition is a historically 【persistent】 topic of education policymaking and reform that impacts national systems of vocational education and training. The transition process refers to a period between 【completion】 of general education and the beginning of vocational education or the beginning of gainful employment as well as to training systems, institutions, and programmes that prepare young people for careers. The status passage of youth from school-to-work has changed structurally under late modernism, and young people are forced to adapt to changing 【demands】 of their environment especially when planning for entry into the labour market. While some young people have developed 【successful】 strategies to cope with these requirements, those undereducated and otherwise disadvantaged in society often face serious problems when trying to prepare for careers. Longer transitions lead to greater vulnerability and to risky 【behaviours】.

38.Australia Higher Education Funding. 澳大利亚高等教育经费  

Financing of Australian higher education has undergone dramatic change since the early 1970s. Although the Australian Government provided regular funding for universities from the late 1950s, in 1974, it 【assumed】 full responsibility for funding higher education, abolishing tuition fees with the intention of making university 【accessible】 to all Australians who had the ability and who wished to participate in higher education.
Since the late 1980s, there has been a move towards greater private contributions, 【particularly】 students fees. In 1989, the Australian Government 【introduced】 the Higher Education Contribution Scheme which included a loans scheme to help students finance their contributions. This enabled universities to remain accessible to students by delaying their payments until they could afford to pay off their loans. In 2002, the Australian Government introduced a scheme similar to HECS for postgraduate students, the Postgraduate Education Loan Scheme.
Funding for higher education comes from various sources. This article examines the three main sources, Australian Government funding, students fees and charges, and HECS. While the proportion of total 【revenue】 raised through HECS is relatively small, HECS payments are a significant component of students' university costs, with many students carrying a HECS debt for several years after leaving university. This article also focuses on characteristics of university students based on their HECS liability status, and the level of accumulated HECS debt.

39.Carbon Detox. 碳排毒  

In his 【fascinating】 book Carbon Detox, George Marshall argues that people are not persuaded by information. Our views are formed by the views of the people with whom we mix. Of the 【narratives】 that might penetrate these circles, we are more likely to listen to those that offer us some reward. A story that tells us that the world is cooking and that we'll have to make sacrifices for the sake of future generations is less likely to be accepted than the more rewarding idea that climate change is a conspiracy hatched by scheming governments and venal scientists, and that strong, independent-minded people should unite to defend their freedoms.
He proposes that instead of arguing for sacrifice, 【environmentalists】 should show where the rewards might lie: that understanding what the science is saying and planning accordingly is the smart thing do, which will protect your interests more effectively than flinging 【abuse】 at scientists. We should 【emphasise】 the old-fashioned virtues of uniting in the face of a crisis, of resourcefulness and community action. Projects like the transition town's network and proposals for a green new deal tell a story which people are more willing to hear.

40.Social Isolation. 社会隔离  

Sound depressing, even apocalyptic? Well, it could be the future. If government 【forecasts】 are right, about 20 years from now, two out of five households will be single 【occupancy】. And there is evidence the situation is already 【deteriorating】. According to a report, Social Isolation in America, published in American Sociological Review in 2006, the average American today has only two close friends. Twenty-five percent of those surveyed said they do not have anyone to talk with about important things. And yet, while some are 【declaring】 a crisis in our ability to make friends, others are saying exactly the opposite. For example, MSN's Anatomy of Friendship Report, published last November, suggests that the average Briton has 54 friends, a 【spectacular】 rise of 64 percent since 2003.

41.Essays. 论文  

Essays are used as an assessment tool to 【evaluate】 your ability to research a topic and construct an 【argument】, as well as your understanding of subject content. This does not mean that essays are a' regurgitation' of everything your lecture has said 【throughout】 the course. Essays are your opportunity to explore in greater 【depth】.

42.Ikebana. 花道  

More than simply putting flowers in a 【container】, Ikebana is a 【disciplined】 art form in which nature and humanity are brought together. Contrary to the 【idea】 of a particolored or multicoloured 【arrangement】 of blossoms, Ikebana often emphasises other areas of the 【plant】, such as its stems and leaves, and puts emphasis on shape, line, and form.
Though Ikebana is an 【expression】 of creativity, certain rules govern its form. The artist's intention behind each arrangement is shown through a piece's colour combinations, natural shapes, graceful lines, and the implied meaning of the arrangement.

43.Heart disease. 心脏病  

If you have a 【chronic】 disease such as heart disease, diabetes, asthma, or back or joint pain, exercise can have important health 【benefits】. However, it is important to talk to your doctor before starting an exercise 【routine】. He or she might have 【advice】 on what exercises are safe and any precautions you might need to take while exercising.

44.Poverty. 贫困  

Measuring poverty on a global scale 【requires】 establishing a 【uniform】 poverty level across extremely divergent economies, which can result in only rough comparisons. The World Bank has defined the international poverty line as U.S. 1$ and 2$ per day in 1993 Purchasing Power Parity, which adjusts for differences in the 【prices】 of goods and services between countries. The 1$ per day level is generally used for the 【least】 developed countries, primarily African; the 2-per-day level is used for middle 【income】 economies such as those of East Asia and Latin America.

45.Impressionist. 印象派画家  

Impressionism was a nineteenth-century art movement that began as a loose association of Paris-based artists who started publicly exhibiting their art in the 1860s. Characteristics of Impressionist painting include visible brush strokes, light colours, open composition, 【emphasis】 on light in its changing qualities, often accentuating the effects of the passage of time, ordinary subject matter, and unusual visual angles. The name of the movement is 【derived】 from Claude Monet's Impression, Sunrise, Impression, Soleil Levant. Critic Louis Leroy inadvertently coined the term in a satiric review published in Le Charivari.
Radicals in their time, early Impressionists broke the rules of academic painting. They began by giving colours, freely brushed, primacy over line, drawing 【inspiration】 from the work of painters such as Eugene Delacroix. They also took the 【act】 of painting out of the studio and into the world. Previously, not only still lives and portraits, but also landscapes had been painted indoors, but the Impressionists found that they could 【capture】 the momentary and transient effects of sunlight by painting air, in plain air.

46.Pinker. 平克（心理学家）  

In a sequence of bestsellers, including The Language Instinct and How the Mind Works, Pinker has argued the swathes of our mental, social and emotional lives may have 【originated】 as evolutionary adaptions, well suited to the lives our ancestors eked out on the Pleistocene savannah. Sometimes it seems as if nothing is 【immune】 from being explained this way. Road rage, adultery, marriage, altruism, our tendency to reward senior executives with corner offices on the top floor, and the smaller number of women who become mechanical engineers all may have their 【roots】 in natural selection, Pinker claims. The controversial implications are obvious: that men and women might 【differ】 in their inborn abilities at performing certain tasks, for example, or that parenting may have 【little】 influence on personality.

47.Video-conferencing technology. 视频会议技术  

Never has the carbon footprint of multi-national corporations been under such intense scrutiny. Inter-city train journeys and long-haul flights to 【conduct】 face-to-face business meetings contribute significantly to greenhouse gases and the resulting 【strain】 on the environment.
The Anglo-US company Teliris has introduced a new video-conferencing technology and partnered with the Carbon Neutral Company, enabling corporate outfits to become more environmentally responsible. The innovation allows simulated face-to-face meetings to be held across continents without the time 【pressure】 or environmental burden of international travel.
Previous designs have enabled video-conferencing on a point-to-point, dual-location basis. The firm's VirtuaLive technology, however, can bring people together from up to five 【separate】 locations anywhere in the world, with 【unrivalled】 transmission quality.

48.Professor Phoenix. 菲尼克斯教授  

Moreover, for Professor David Phoenix, the dean of the faculty of science and technology, the return of single-honors 【chemistry】 is a 【matter】 of credibility and pride."If you say you're a science faculty, you have to have all the core sciences, and this course will mean we attract a new supply of potential Masters and PhD students in chemistry."
Phoenix is adamant that the new course will teach solid chemistry, but he thinks that an attraction for students will be a teaching approach that 【differs】 significantly from his days as an undergraduate. This takes real-life issues as the starting point of lectures and modules, such as how drugs are made or the science behind green issues. Out of this study, he says, students will be exposed to the same core chemistry unchanged over decades, but they will be doing it in a way that is more 【engaging】 and more likely to lead to more fundamental learning. It is an approach that 【symbolises】 chemistry's recent success story: moving with the times, while holding fast to the subject's essential role as a building block of science and technological advance.

49.Monkey. 猴子  

This 【illustration】 often used is the one that the monkeys and the 【typewriters】. Ok, we have a monkey sitting at a typewriter, and the claim here is basically if you leave to chance in a time long enough you will get a life, don't worry about it, yes it's strange. Yes, it's wonderful: but leave enough matter 600 million years on earth, and you will have the life. So, the monkey sitting at the typewriter, the chances are eventually he produces the complete works of Shakespeare Douglass the problem. So there's no problem. There is no issue: right? You just leave it long enough, and you'll find. And one key striker seconds, the monkey might well eventually get to you the complete works of Shakespeare, but he doesn't manage to do it in 600 million years. So what I decided to do is to run the numbers. I instead of saying typing the complete work of Shakespeare, I just run the number for how long would it take a monkey typing one key striker a second. To type to be or not to be that is the question. Right? On average how Iong is it taking my monkey friend one keystroke a second. I don't know how you think it would be. Maybe you could have a guess. Would it be less or more than 600 million years which is the period life on earth isn't supposed to have emerged within and when I run the numbers to be or not? To be that is the question takes 12 points six trillion trillion trillion years to type just that phrase, and a DNA 【string】 has got as much as information the 【encyclopaedia】 Britannica. Are we saying that something of that complexity emerges by chance undirected within 600 million years? Again, it's mathematically possible but ifs so incredibly unlikely that it would have that it 【tilts】 me in favour of the Cristian story in which God is creating life simply a question of saying let that be, and there was.

50.Learning by Doing. 做中学  

An analysis of more than 500 graduates found no significant difference between business schools that offered traditional courses and those that emphasise a' learning- by- doing' approach to entrepreneurship education. The research challenges the ongoing trend across higher education institutes' HEIs' of 【focusing】 on experiential learning, and suggests that universities need to reconsider their approach if they 【are to】 increase entrepreneurship among their students. Ms Inna Kozlinska, research associate at Aston Business School and author of the study, said:' Entrepreneurship education 【is seen】 as a major force capable of generating long- term socio- economic changes through developing entrepreneurial, creative, flexible and wise individuals. There is an ongoing shift towards experiential learning in business schools, 【yet】 there is little empirical evidence to suggest this approach has better impact than traditional learning.'

51.Space work. 太空作业  

The space work for an astronaut can be inside or outside, inside they can monitor machines, and the work is 【carried】 out alongside the craft. They also need to make sure the Space 【Travel】. 【Outside】 the craft, they can see how the seeds react in the space. Some seeds company send seeds to them to 【investigate】 how seeds change their biological character. When outside the craft, they can set 【up】 experiments or clean up the space rubbish.

52.Dog. 狗  

A DOG may be man's best friend. But man is not always a dog's. Over the centuries 【selective】 breeding has pulled at the canine body shape to produce what is often a grotesque distortion of the underlying wolf. Indeed, some of these distortions are, when found in people, regarded as 【pathologies】. Dog breeding does, though, offer a chance to those who would like to understand how body shape is controlled. The ancestry of pedigree pooches is well recorded, their generation time is short and their 【litter】 size reasonably large, so there is plenty of material to work with. 【Moreover】, breeds are, by definition, inbred, and this simplifies genetic analysis. Those such as Elaine Ostrander, of America's National Human Genome Research Institute, who wish to identify the genetic basis of the features of particular pedigrees thus have an 【ideal】 experimental animal.

53.Parliament. 议会  

No one in Parliament would know better than Peter Garrett what largesse copyright can confer so it may seem right that he should announce a 【royalty】 for artists, amounting to 5 percent of all sales after the original one, which can go on giving to their families for as much as 150 years. But that ignores the truth that copyright law is a 【scandal】, recently 【exacerbated】 by the Free Trade Agreement with the US which 【required】 the extension of copyright to 70 years after death.
Is it scandalous that really valuable copyrights end up in the ownership of corporations, although Agatha Christie's no-doubt worthy great-grandchildren are still 【reaping】 the benefits of West End success for her whodunnits and members of the Garrick Club enjoy the continuing fruits of A.A. Milne's Christopher Robin books? No. The 【scandals】 are that bien peasants politicians have attempted to appear cultured by creating private assets which depend on an act of Parliament for their existence and by giving away much more in value than any public benefit could 【justify】. In doing so, they have betrayed our trust.

54.Egg-eating snakes. 食蛋蛇  

Egg-eating snakes are a small group of snakes whose 【diet】 consists only of eggs. Some eat only bird's eggs, which they have to swallow 【whole】, as the snake has no teeth. Instead, some other snakes eat bigger eggs, but it requires special 【treatment】. These snakes have spines that stick out from the backbone. The spines 【crack】 the egg 【open】 as it passes through the throat.
Once the egg is 【punctured】, muscles in the snake's body work in waves to 【squeeze】 out the contents, which then move down into the stomach. The snake then forces the shell back into its mouth by bending its body into an' S' shape. The shell is now drained and flattened into a compact shape. Egg eating snakes sometimes have to go for a long time without any food. So, they eat as many eggs as they can when they get them!

55.Artists. 艺术家  

In the U.S., artists in the mid-1950s began to create a 【bridge】 to Pop. Strongly influenced by Dada and its 【emphasis】 on appropriation and everyday objects, artists increasingly worked with 【collage】, consumer products, and a healthy dose of irony. Jasper Johns 【reimagined】 iconic imagery like the American flag Robert Rauschenberg employed silk-screen printings and found objects and Larry Rivers used images of mass-produced goods. All three are considered American 【forerunners】 of Pop.

56.Job-hunting. 求职  

When it comes to job-hunting, first 【impressions】 are critical. Remember, you are marketing a product, yourself, to a potential employer. The first thing the employer sees when greeting you is your 【attire】; thus, you must make every effort to have the proper dress for the type of job you are seeking. Will dressing properly get you the job? Of course not, but it will give you a competitive edge and a 【positive】 first impression.
Should you be judged by what you wear? Perhaps not, but the reality is, of course, that you are judged. Throughout the entire job-seeking process employers use short-cuts, heuristics or rules of thumb, to save time. With cover letters, it's the opening paragraph and a quick scan of your qualifications. With resumes, it is a quick scan of your accomplishments. With the job interview, it's how you're dressed that sets the 【tone】 of the interview.
How should you dress? Dressing conservatively is always the safest route, but you should also try and do a little 【investigation】 of your 【prospective】 employer so that what you wear to the interview makes you look as though you 【fit】 in with the organisation. If you overdress, which is rare but can happen, or underdress, the more likely scenario, the potential employer may feel that you don't care enough about the job.

57.Votes. 投票  

It is tempting to try to prove that good looks win votes, and many academics have tried. The 【difficulty】 is that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and you cannot behold a politician's face without a veil of extraneous 【prejudice】 getting in the way. Does George Bush possess a disarming grin or a facetious 【smirk】? It's hard to find anyone who can look at the president without assessing him politically as well as 【physically】.

58.Animals coordination. 动物协作  

In animals, a movement is coordinated by a cluster of neurons in the spinal cord called the central patterns generator, CPG. This produces signals that drive muscles to 【contract】 rhythmically in a way that produces running or walking, depending on the 【pattern】 of pulses. A simple signal from the brain instructs the CPG to switch between different 【modes】, such as going from a standstill to walking.

59.Alaska's Aleutian Islands. 阿拉斯加阿留申群岛  

The few people who live in Alaska's the Aleutian Islands have long been accustomed to shipwrecks. They have been part of local consciousness since a Japanese whaling ship ran 【aground】 near the western end of the 1,100-mile, 1,800-km, volcanic 【archipelago】 in 1780, inadvertently naming what is now Rat Island when the ship's infestation 【scurried】 ashore and made itself at home. Since then, there have been at least 190 shipwrecks in the islands.

60.Australia and New Zealand. 澳大利亚与新西兰  

Australia and New Zealand have many common links. Both countries were recently settled by Europeans, are predominantly English speaking and in that sense, share a common cultural 【heritage】. Although in close proximity to one another, both countries are geographically isolated and have small populations by world 【standards】. They have similar histories and enjoy 【close】 relations on many fronts. In terms of population 【characteristics】, Australia and New Zealand have much in common. Both countries have minority indigenous populations, and during the latter half of the 20th century have seen a steady stream of migrants from a variety of regions throughout the world. Both countries have 【experienced】 similar declines in fertility since the high levels recorded during the baby boom, and alongside this have enjoyed the benefits of continually improving life expectancy. One consequence of these trends is that both countries are faced with an ageing population, and the 【associated】 challenge of providing appropriate care and support for this growing group within the community.

61.Device of Drying Hay. 干草干燥装置  

A novel device for helping farmers to dry out hay more quickly has won a University of Glasgow graduate a prestigious design award. Gavin Armstrong, 23, from Kippen, Stirlingshire 【scooped】 the Glasgow 1999 Design Medal for his design for a swath inverter, a 【device】 for flipping over a hay crop to help dry out the damp underside. Dry hay is an essential farmyard food source for sheep and cows. Gavin came up 【with】 the design as part of his Product Design Engineering degree course, run in 【conjunction】 with Glasgow School of Art. He built a working prototype of the device which is powered and towed by a tractor and uses a pair of parallel belts to invert the swath. The rollers are driven from one hydraulic motor and are geared so as to spin at the same speed and in opposite directions 【ensuring】 that the touching inner two faces of the belt that perform the inversion move rearwards at the same speed.

62.Serving on a jury. 担任陪审员  

Serving on a jury is normally compulsory for individuals who are 【qualified】 for jury service. A jury is 【intended】 to be an impartial panel capable of reaching a verdict. There are often 【Procedures】 and requirements, including a fluent understanding of the language and the opportunity to test jurors' neutrality or otherwise exclude jurors who are perceived as likely to be less than 【neutral】 or partial to one side.

63.Investment. 投资  

One city will start to attract the 【majority】 of public or private investment. This could be due to 【natural】 advantage or political decisions. This, in turn, will 【stimulate】 further investment due to the multiplier effect and 【significant】 rural to urban migration. The investment in this city will be at the 【expense】 of other cities.

64.Andersen’s tales. 安徒生童话  

Fans of biographical criticism have a luxurious source in the works of Hans Christian Andersen. Like Lewis Carroll, and, to a lesser extent, Kenneth Grahame, Andersen was near-pathologically uncomfortable in the company of adults. Of course, all three had to work and 【interact】 with adults, but all three really related well to children and their simpler worlds. Andersen, for a time, ran a puppet theatre and was incredibly popular with children, and, of course, he wrote an impressive body of fairy tales which have been produced in thousands of editions since the 19th century.
Most everyone has read or at least knows the titles of many of Andersen's works:"The Ugly Duckling,""The Emperor's New Clothes,""The Nightengale,""The Little Mermaid,""The Match Girl," and many others. Though, as with most folk and fairy tales, they 【strike】 adult re-readers much differently than they do young first-time readers.
Charming tales of ducks who feel 【awkward】 because they don't fit in, only to exult in the discovery that they are majestic swans, gives child readers clearly-identifiable messages: don't tease people because they're different; don't fret about your being different because someday you'll discover what special 【gifts】 you have. A closer, deeper look at many of Andersen's tales, including"The Ugly Duckling," which is not on our reading list, reveals a darker, harder, more 【painful】 thread. People are often cruel and unfeeling, love is torturous, in general, the things of the material world cause suffering. There is often a happy ending, but it's not conventionally happy. Characters are rewarded, but only after they manage, often through death, to transcend the rigours of the mortal world.

65.Dairy farms. 奶牛场  

A few summers ago I visited two dairy farms, Huls Farm and Gardar Farm, which despite being located thousands of miles apart were still remarkably similar in their strengths and vulnerabilities. Both were by far the largest, most prosperous, most technologically advanced farms in their 【respective】 districts. In particular, each was centred around a magnificent state-of-the-art barn for 【sheltering】 and milking cows. Those structures, both neatly 【divided】 into opposite-facing rows of cow stalls, dwarfed all other barns in the district. Both farms let their cows graze outdoors in lush pastures during the summer, produced their hay to harvest in the late summer for feeding the cows through the winter, and 【increased】 their production of summer fodder and winter hay by 【irrigating】 their fields. The two farms were similar in an area, a few square miles, and barn size, Huls barn holding somewhat more cows than Gardar barn, 200 vs 165 cows, respectively. The owners of both farms were viewed as leaders of their respective societies. Both owners were deeply religious. Both farms were located in gorgeous natural settings that attract tourists from afar, with backdrops of high snow-capped mountains drained by streams teaming with fish, and sloping down to a famous river, below Huls Farm, or fjord, below Gardar Farm.

66.Dark energy. 暗能量  

The rest of the universe appears to be made of a mysterious, invisible 【substance】 called dark matter and a force that repels gravity known as dark energy. Scientists have not yet 【observed】 dark matter directly. It doesn't interact with baryonic matter, and it's completely invisible to light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation, making dark matter 【impossible】 to 【detect】 with current instruments. But scientists are confident it exists because of the gravitational effects it appears to have on galaxies and galaxy clusters.
The visible universe, including Earth, the sun, other stars, and galaxies, is made of protons, neutrons, and electrons bundled together into atoms. Perhaps one of the most surprising 【discoveries】 of the 20th century was that this ordinary, or baryonic, 【matter】 makes up less than 5 percent of the mass of the universe.

67.Water security. 水安全  

Equally critical is the challenge of water security. The UN Environment Program, UNEP, has pointed out that about one-third of the world's population lives in countries with moderate to high water stress, with a 【disproportionate】 impact on the poor.
With current projected global population growth, the task of providing water for human 【sustenance】 will become increasingly difficult.
And increasing competition over this scarce but vital resource may fuel instability and conflict within states as well as between states.
The UN is doing a great deal in both areas to proactively foster 【collaboration】 among Member States.
UNEP has long been actively addressing the water issue together with partner UN 【agencies】 and other organisations. Looking ahead, the UN can do more to build synergies of technology, policy and capacity in this field. In this regard, events like the annual World Water Week in Stockholm come to the forefront of the public mind when talking about 【championing】 water issues.

68.Headmaster. 校长  

David Lynch is professor and head of education at Charles Darwin University. 【Prior】 to this, he was sub-dean in the Faculty of Education and Creative Arts at Central Queensland University and foundation head of the University's Noosa 【campus】. David's career in education began as a primary school teacher in Queensland in the early 1980's and 【progressed】 to four principal positions before 【entering】 higher education. David's research interests predominate in teacher education with particular interest in building teacher 【capability】 to meet a changed world.

69.Allergies. 过敏  

What Are Allergies?
Allergies are abnormal immune system reactions to things that are typically harmless to most people. When you're allergic to something, your immune system 【mistakenly】 believes that this substance is harmful to your body. Substances that cause allergic reactions, such as certain foods, dust, plant pollen, or medicines, are known as allergens.
In an attempt to 【protect】 the body, the immune system produces IgE antibodies to that allergen. Those antibodies then cause certain cells in the body to 【release】 chemicals into the bloodstream, one of which is histamine.
The histamine then 【acts】 on the eyes, nose, throat, lungs, skin, or gastrointestinal tract and causes the symptoms of the allergic reaction. Future exposure to that same allergen will trigger this 【antibody】 response again. This means that every time you come into contact with that allergen, you'll have some form of allergy symptoms.

70.Non-attendance. 缺勤  

In reality, however, the causes of truancy and non-attendance are diverse and multifaceted. There are as many 【triggers】 of non-attendance as there are non-attenders. Each child has her own 【unique】 story, and whilst there may often be certain identifiable factors in common, each non-attending child demands and 【deserves】 an individual response, tailored to meet her individual needs. This applies 【equally】 to the 14-year-old who fails to attend school because a parent is terminally ill, the overweight 11-year-old who fails to attend because he is 【embarrassed】 about changing for PE in front of peers, the 15-year-old who is' bored' by lessons, and to the seven-year-old who is teased in the playground because she does not wear the latest designer-label clothes.

71.Leadership. 领导力  

Leadership is all about being granted permission by others to lead their thinking. It is a bestowed moral authority that gives the right to organise and direct the efforts of others. But moral authority does not come from simply managing people effectively or communicating better or being able to motivate. It comes from many 【sources】, including being authentic and genuine, having integrity, and showing a real and deep understanding of the business in question. All these 【factors】 build confidence.
Leaders lose moral authority for three reasons: they behave 【unethically】; they become plagued by self-doubt and lose their conviction, or they are blinded by power, lose self-awareness and thus lose 【connection】 with those they lead as the context around them changes.
Having said all this, it has to be assumed that if someone becomes a leader, at some point they understood the difference between right and wrong. It is up to them to 【abide】 by a moral code and up to us to ensure that the moment we suspect they do not, we fire them or vote them out.

72.Legal deposit. 法定寄存  

Legal deposit has existed in English law since 1662. It helps to ensure that the nation's published output, and thereby its 【intellectual】 record and future published heritage, is collected systematically, to 【preserve】 the material for the use of future generations and to make it available for 【readers】 within the designated legal deposit libraries.
The Legal Deposit Libraries are the British Library, the National Library of Scotland, the National Library of Wales, the Bodleian Libraries, Oxford and the University Library, Cambridge. The legal deposit system also has 【benefits】 for authors and publishers: Deposited publications are made available to users of the deposit libraries on their premises, are preserved for the benefit of future generations, and become part of the nation's heritage. Publications are recorded in the online catalogues and become an essential 【research】 resource for generations to come.

73.Bronze vs Silver. 青铜与白银  

In an often-cited study about counterfactuals, Medvec, Madey, and Gilovich found that bronze medalists appeared happier than silver medalists in television coverage of the 1992 Summer Olympics. Medvec et al. 【argued】 that bronze medalists compared themselves to 4th place finishers, 【whereas】 silver medalists compared themselves to gold medalists. These counterfactuals were the most 【salient】 because they were either qualitatively different, gold vs silver, or categorically different, medal vs no medal, from what 【actually】 occurred. Drawing on archival data and experimental studies, we show that Olympic athletes, among others, are more likely to make counterfactual comparisons based on their 【prior】 expectations, consistent with decision affect theory. Silver medalists are more likely to be disappointed because their personal expectations are higher than 【those】 of bronze medalists. We provide a test between expectancy-based versus category-based processing and discuss circumstances that trigger each type of processing.

74.Arbitration. 仲裁  

Arbitration is a method of conflict resolution which, with more or less formalised mechanisms, occurs in many political and legal spheres. There are two main 【characteristics】 to arbitration. The first is that it is a voluntary process under which two parties in conflict agree between themselves to be 【bound】 by the judgement of a third party which has no other authority over them; the judgement, 【however】, is not legally binding. The second is that there is usually no clear body of 【law】 or set of rules that must apply; the arbitrator is free, 【subject】 to any prior agreement with the conflicting parties, to decide on whatever basis of justice is deemed 【suitable】.

75.Southern cone. 南锥体地区  

In the southern cone especially, from Venezuela to Argentina, the region is rising to overthrow the legacy of external domination of the past centuries and the cruel and destructive social forms that they have helped to establish. The 【mechanisms】 of imperial control, violence and economic warfare, hardly a distant memory in Latin America, are losing their effectiveness, a sign of the shift toward independence. Washington is now compelled to tolerate governments that in the past would have drawn intervention or reprisal. Throughout the region a vibrant 【array】 of popular movements provides the basis for a meaningful democracy. The indigenous populations, as if in a rediscovery of their pre-Columbian legacy, are much more active and influential, particularly in Bolivia and Ecuador. These developments are in part the result of a 【phenomenon】 that has been observed for some years in Latin America: As the elected governments become more formally democratic, citizens 【express】 an increasing disillusionment with democratic institutions. They have sought to construct democratic systems based on popular participation rather than elite and foreign 【domination】.

76.Joseph Engelberger. 约瑟夫·恩格尔伯格  

Joseph Engelberger, a pioneer in industrial robotics, once remarked"l can't 【define】 a robot, but I know one when I see one." If you consider all the different machines people 【call】 robots, you can see that it's nearly impossible to come up with a 【comprehensive】 definition. Everybody has a different 【idea】 of what constitutes a robot.

77.Conservationists. 环保主义者  

Conservationists have long debated whether the koala should go on the Australian national threatened species list. 【While】 the koala is clearly in trouble in some parts of the country- in Queensland, for example, high numbers 【are afflicted】 by disease- in other parts such as Victoria and South Australia the problem is not that koala populations 【are falling】, but that they have grown to the point where they are almost too numerous. For a species to be classed as vulnerable, its population 【must have decreased】 by more than 30 percent over the last three generations or 10 years. The problem is that when such a stipulation is applied to koalas, the Victorian boom offsets the Queensland bust, and the species stays off the list. This has repercussions because northern koalas are different to southern ones. They are smaller, for example, and they contain a genetic 【variation】 not represented in the South. 【For this reason】, a split listing has been devised koalas from New South Wales, the ACT and Queensland are now officially' Vulnerable'; those from Victoria and South Australia are not considered threatened.

78.Expedition. 远征  

This summer, 41 UBC alumni and friends participated in 【expeditions】 to the Canadian Arctic and the legendary Northwest Passage. Presentations, conversations and learning accompanied their exploration of the great 【outdoors】 aboard the Russian-flagged Akademik Ioffe, designed and built in Finland as a scientific research vessel in 1989. Her bridge was open to passengers virtually 24 hours a day. Experts on 【board】 presented on topics including climate change, wildlife, Inuit culture and history, and early European explorers. UBC professor Michael Byers presented on the issue of Arctic sovereignty, a 【growing】 cause of debate as ice melts, new shipping routes open, and natural resources 【become】 accessible. Recommended pre-trip reading was late UBC alumnus Pierre Bertons book, The Arctic Grail.

79.Surgery. 外科手术  

Before effective anaesthetics, surgery was very crude and very painful. Before 1800, alcohol and opium had 【little】 success in easing pain during operations. Laughing gas was used in 1844 in dentistry in the USA, but failed to ease all pain and patients 【remained】 conscious. Ether, used from 1846, made patients totally unconscious and 【lasted】 a long time. However, it could make patients cough during operations and sick afterwards. It was highly flammable and was 【transported】 in heavy glass bottles. Chloroform, used from 1847, was very effective with few side effects. However, it was difficult to get the dose right and could kill some people 【because of】 the effect on their heart. An inhaler helped to regulate the dosage.

80.Bee. 蜜蜂  

According to a research conducted by Cambridge University, flowers can find their own ways to attract insects to help them pollinate. Flowers will release an 【irresistible】 smell. Beverley Glover from the University of Cambridge and her 【colleagues】 did an experiment in which they use fake flowers to attract bees and insects. In their experiments, they freed many bumblebees from their 【origins】 repeatedly and got the same 【result】.

81.Interdisciplinary center. 跨学科中心  

A new interdisciplinary center for the study of the frontiers of the universe, from the tiniest subatomic particle to the largest chain of galaxies, has been formed at The University of Texas at Austin. The Texas Cosmology Center will be a way for the university's departments of Astronomy and Physics to 【collaborate】 on research that concerns them both."This center will bring the two departments together in an area where they 【overlap】 in the physics of the very early universe," said Dr. Neal Evans, Astronomy Department chair. Astronomical observations have 【revealed】 the presence of dark matter and dark energy, discoveries that challenge our knowledge of fundamental physics. And today's leading theories in physics involve energies so high that no Earth-bound particle accelerator can test them. They need the universe as their 【laboratory】. Dr. Steven Weinberg, Nobel laureate and professor of physics at the university, called the Center's 【advent】"a very exciting development" for that department.

82.Sales Jobs. 销售工作  

Sales jobs allow for a 【great】 deal of discretionary time and effort on the part of the sales representatives, especially when compared with managerial, manufacturing, and service jobs. Most sales representatives work independently and outside the immediate presence of their sales managers. Therefore, some form of goals needs to be in place 【to motivate and guide】 their performance. Sales personnel are not the only professionals with performance goals or quotas. Health care professionals operating in clinics have daily, weekly, and monthly goals in terms of patient visits. Service personnel are assigned a number of service calls they 【must perform】 during a set time period. Production workers in manufacturing have output goals. So, why are achieving sales goals or quotas such a big deal? The answer to this question can be found by examining how a firm's other departments are affected by how well the company's salespeople achieve their performance goals. The success of the business 【hinges on】 the successful sales of its products and services. Consider all the planning, the financial, production and marketing efforts that go into 【producing what】 the sales force sells. Everyone depends on the sales force to sell the company's products and services and they eagerly anticipate knowing things are going.

83.Brain actions. 大脑活动  

Researchers in Europe and the US wanted to find out exactly what happens to our brain when we find ourselves stunned with fright in the hope of better understanding how fear interplays with human anxiety disorders.
For the first time, they traced and linked three parts of the brain 【responsible】 for freezing behaviours: the amygdala, ventrolateral periaqueductal grey region and magnocellular nucleus.
Mice are excellent lab animals where it comes to anxiety and fear experiments. When a mouse is scared, its defensive behaviours range from freezing, attacking, risk 【assessment】 or fleeing the scene. How a mouse acts depends on variables such as access to escape routes or the level of threat faced.
So Andreas Luthi at the Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research in Switzerland and colleagues from Europe and the US observed brain activity in mice placed in frightening situations to 【trace】 the brain circuits responsible for freezing behaviours.
In particular, the researchers wanted to learn more about a part of the brain called the ventrolateral periaqueductal grey region, which was believed to 【play】 some part in a mouse's instinct to freeze or flee.

84.Anxiety. 焦虑  

It's that time again: exams looming, essays or reports outstanding and you wonder where the year's gone already. You start 【wondering】 how you going to cope with it all. Fear and anxiety are 【insidious】 things and they can take hold if you don't do something about them. This amounts to a bad type of stress which is just what you don't need, especially at this time of year. This is not to say that all anxiety is bad, however. A limited amount of anxiety can help you to be more motivated and more 【purposeful】. It can help you to plan your work and to think more clearly and 【logically】 about it. In other words, it can help you to stay on top of things. So how can you limit your stress and stay in control? There are a number of practical things you can do, even at this late stage before the exams. Don't give up hope, even if you start to feel snowballed when you think of the all the work you have to do. First of all, it's essential to get yourself organised. Sit down at your desk and make a start on writing down all the things you have to do to 【prepare】 for the exams. If you feel there's too much to do, then work out priorities for your work. Outstanding assignments should take priority but make sure to leave time for revision of your lecture notes.

85.Fluid. 流体  

If you see a movie, or a TV advertisement, that involves a fluid behaving in an unusual way, it was probably made using technology based on the work of a Monash researcher. Professor Joseph Monaghan who pioneered an influential 【method】 for interpreting the behaviour of liquids that underlies most special effects involving water has been 【honoured】 with election to the Australian Academy of Sciences.
Professor Monaghan, one of only 17 members elected in 2011, was recognised for developing the method of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics, SPH, which has applications in the fields of astrophysics, engineering and physiology, as well as movie special effects.
His research started in 1977 when he tried to use computer 【simulation】 to describe the formation of stars and stellar systems. The algorithms available at the time were 【incapable】 of describing the complicated systems that evolve out of chaotic clouds of gas in the galaxy.
Professor Monaghan, and his colleague Bob Gingold, took the novel and effective approach of replacing the fluid or gas in the simulation with large numbers of particles with properties that 【mimicked】 those of the fluid. SPH has become a central tool in astrophysics, where it is currently used to simulate the evolution of the universe after the Big Bang, the formation of stars, and the processes of planet building.

86.Kiwi. 几维鸟/新西兰人  

A Massey ecologist has teamed up with a leading wildlife photographer to produce the definitive book on New Zealand's national bird, the kiwi. Kiwi: A Natural History was written by Dr. Isabel Castro and 【features】 photographs by Rod Morris. Dr. Castro has been working with kiwi 【since】 1999, with a focus on their behaviour."I've specifically been looking at the sense of smell that kiwi uses when foraging, but also in their interactions with their environment and other kiwi," she says. The book covers all aspects of kiwi, from their evolution, prehistory and closest relatives to their feeding and breeding behaviour and current conservation issues, 【making】 this the perfect 【introduction】 for anyone with an interest in these fascinating birds. The book is the second title in a new 【series】 on New Zealand's wildlife, targeted at a family readership.

87.Tomb. 坟墓  

The last tourists may have been leaving the Valley of the Kings on the West Bank in Luxor but the area in front of the tomb of Tutankhamun remained far from deserted. Instead of the 【tranquility】 that usually descends on the area in the evening, it was a hive of activity. TV crews trailed masses of equipment, journalists milled and 【photographers】 held their cameras at the ready. The reason? For the first time since Howard Carter 【discovered】 the tomb in 1922 the mummy of Tutankhamun was being prepared for public display.
Inside the subterranean burial chamber Egypt's archaeology supremo Zahi Hawass, 【accompanied】 by four Egyptologists, two restorers and three workmen, were slowly lifting the mummy from the golden sarcophagus where it has been rested, mostly undisturbed, for more than 3,000 years. The body was then placed on a wooden stretcher and 【transported】 to its new home, a high-tech, climate-controlled plexi-glass showcase located in the outer chamber of the tomb where, covered in linen, with only the face and feet exposed, it now greets visitors.

88.Herbal. 草药  

A herbal is a book of plants, describing their appearance, their properties and how they may be used for preparing ointments and medicines. The medical use of plants is 【recorded】 on fragments of papyrus and clay tablets from ancient Egypt, Samaria and China that date back 5,000 years but document traditions far older still. Over 700 herbal remedies were detailed in the Papyrus Ebers, an Egyptian text written in 1500 BC.
Around 65 BC, a Greek physician called Dioscorides wrote a herbal that was 【translated】 into Latin and Arabic. Known as' De materia medica', it became the most influential work on medicinal plants in both Christian and Islamic worlds until the late 17th century. An illustrated manuscript copy of the text made in Constantinople, modern-day Istanbul, 【survives】 from the sixth century.
The first printed herbals date from the dawn of European printing in the 1480s. They provided valuable information for apothecaries, whose job it was to make the pills and potions 【prescribed】 by physicians. In the next century, landmark herbals were produced in England by William Turner, considered to be the father of British botany, and John Gerard, whose illustrations would 【inspire】 the floral fabric, wallpaper and tile designs of William Morris four centuries later.

89.Colorful poison frogs. 彩色毒蛙  

Colourful poison frogs in the Amazon owe their great 【diversity】 to ancestors that leapt into the region from the Andes Mountains several times during the last 10 million years, a new study from The University of Texas at Austin suggests.
This is the first study to show that the Andes have been a major 【source】 of diversity for the Amazon 【basin】, one of the largest 【reservoirs】 of biological diversity on Earth. The finding runs 【counter】 to the idea that Amazonian diversity is the 【result】 of evolution only within the tropical forest itself.
"Basically, the Amazon basin is a' melting pot' for South American frogs," says graduate student Juan Santos, lead author of the study."Poison frogs there have come from multiple places of 【origin】, notably the Andes Mountains, over many millions of years. We have shown that you cannot understand Amazonian biodiversity by looking only in the basin. Adjacent regions have played a major role."

90.Skip school. 逃学  

Children who skip school are increasingly on family holidays, government figures 【revealed】 today. 【Fewer】 children played truant this spring term compared with the spring term last year. Children missed 3 unauthorised days of school last term, compared with 3.7 days of school in the same period last year. But a 【hardcore】 group of truants, 6 percent of the school population, who account for more than three-quarters of all those on unauthorised absence, are more likely to be on a family holiday than they were in the same 【period】 last year. Some 1.2 percent of all absence was for family holidays not 【agreed】 by their school last term, compared with 0.9 percent for the same term last year.
More than 60 percent of all absences were for illness, the same figure as last year.

91.Foreign policy. 外交政策  

The foreign policy of a state, it is often argued, begins and ends with the border. No doubt an exaggeration, this aphorism nevertheless has an 【element】 of truth. A state's relation with its neighbours, at least in the 【formative】 years, are greatly influenced by its frontier policy, especially when there are no 【settled】 borders. Empire builders in the past sought to extend imperial frontiers for a variety of reasons; subjugation of kings and princes to gain their 【allegiance】, as well as handsome tributes or the coffers of the state, and, security of the core of the empire from external attacks by establishing a string of buffer states in areas Adjoining the frontiers. The history of British empire in India was no different. It is important to note in this connexion that the concept of international boundaries, between two sovereign states, demarcated and 【delineated】, was yet to emerge in India under Mughal rule.

92.Food Minding. 食物照管  

At supper Johnson talked of good eating with uncommon 【satisfaction】."Some people," said he,"have a foolish way of not minding, or pretending not to mind, what they eat. For my part, I mind my belly very 【studiously】, and very carefully; for I look upon it, that he who does not mind his belly will hardly mind anything else," He was, for the moment, not only serious but 【vehement】." Yet I have heard him, upon other occasions, talk with great contempt of people who were anxious to gratify their palates; and the 206 th number of his Rambler is a masterly essay against 【gulosity】. His practise, indeed, I must acknowledge, may be considered as casting the balance of his different opinions upon this subject; for I never knew any man who 【relished】 good eating more than he did.

93.Film. 电影  

Film is where art meets commerce. 【As】 Orson Welles said:"A painter just needs a brush and the writer just needs a pen, but the producer needs an army." And an army needs money. A producer is just like an entrepreneur, we 【raise】 money to make films. First, we need to find an original idea or a book or a play and purchase the rights, then we need money to develop that idea often a reasonably small sum. 【Besides】, to commission a writer for the screenplay isn't something you would want to gamble your own money on, so you find a partner. We are lucky here in the UK, as we have Film 4, BBC Films and the UK Film Council, all of 【which】 are good places to develop an idea.
Producing in Britain is very different to producing in America or 【even】 Europe because the economic dynamic is different.

94.Learning online. 在线学习  

Remember when universities were bursting at the seams with students sitting in the aisles, balancing books on their knees?
No more, it seems. E-learning is as likely to stand for empty lecture theatres as for the Internet 【revolution】, which has greatly increased the 【volume】 and range of course materials available online in the past five years.
The 【temptation】 now is to simply think,' Everything will be online so I don't need to go to class'," said Dr Kerri-Lee Krause, of the Center for the Study of Higher Education at the University of Melbourne.
The nation's universities are in the process of opening the doors for the new academic year and, while classes are generally well 【attended】 for the early weeks, it often does not last.
"There is concern at the university level about student 【attendance】 dropping and why students are not coming to lectures." Dr Krause said.
But lecturers' pride, and 【fierce】 competition among universities for students, mean few are willing to acknowledge publicly how poorly attended many classes are.

95.English Language. 英语语言  

English is the world's language. Such 【dominance】 has its downside, of course. There are now about 6,800 languages left in the world, compared with perhaps 【twice】 that number back at the dawn of agriculture. Thanks in 【part】 to the rise of uber-languages, most importantly English, the remaining languages are now dying at the 【rate】 of about one a fortnight.

96.Agrarian parties. 农业政党  

Agrarian parties are political parties chiefly representing the interests of peasants or, more broadly, the 【rural】 sector of society. The extent to which they are important, or 【whether】 they even exist, depends mainly on two factors. One, obviously, is the size of an identifiable peasantry, or the size of the rural relative 【to】 the urban population. The other is a matter of social integration: 【for】 agrarian parties to be important, the representation of countryside or peasantry must not be integrated with the other major sections of society. 【Thus】 a country might possess a sizable rural population but have an economic system in which the interests of the voters were predominantly related to their incomes, 【not】 to their occupations or location.

97.Most respected companies. 最受尊敬的公司  

Look at the recent"Most Respected Companies" survey by the Financial Times. Who are the most respected companies and business leaders at the 【current】 time? Rather predictably, they are Jack Welch and General Electric, and Bill Gates, and Microsoft. 【Neither】 has achieved their world-class status through playing nice. Welch is still remembered for the brutal downsizing he led his business 【through】, and for the environmental pollution incidents and prosecutions. Microsoft has had one of the 【highest】 profile cases of bullying market dominance of recent times- and Gates has been able to 【achieve】 the financial status where he can choose to give lots of money away by being ruthless in business.

98.Intelligence comparing. 智力比较  

Comparing the intelligence of animals of different species is difficult, how do you compare a dolphin and a horse? Psychologists have a technique for looking at intelligence that 【does】 not require the cooperation of the animal involved. The relative size of an individual's brain is a reasonable indication of intelligence. Comparing 【across】 species is not as simple an elephant will have a larger brain than a human simple because it is a large beast. 【Instead】 we use the Cephalization index, which compare the size of an animal's brain to the size of its body. Based on the Cephalization index, the brightest animals on the planet are humans, 【followed】 by great apes, porpoises and elephants. As a general 【rule】, animals that hunt for a living, like canines, are smarter than strict vegetarians- you don't need much intelligence to outsmart a leaf of lettuce. Animals that live in social groups are always smarter and have large EQ's than solitary animals.

99.Northern spotted owls. 北方斑点猫头鹰  

Our analysis of the genetic structure of northern spotted owls across most of the range of the subspecies allowed us to test for genetic discontinuities and identify landscape features that influence the subspecies' genetic structure. Although no 【distinct】 genetic breaks were found in northern spotted owls, 【several】 landscape features were important in structuring genetic variation. Dry, low elevation valleys and the high elevation Cascade and Olympic Mountains restricted gene flow, while the lower Oregon Coast Range 【facilitated】 gene flow, acting as a"genetic corridor." The Columbia River did not act as a 【barrier】, 【suggesting】 owls 【readily】 fly over this large river. Thus, even in taxa such as northern spotted owls with potential for long-distance dispersal, landscape features can have an important impact on gene flow and genetic structure.

100.Cognitive Health. 认知健康  

Neuropsychological testing is one way to 【assess】 cognitive health. However, this option can be costly and labour intensive. In many cases, basic screening will suffice for an understanding of a given individual's cognitive health status. There are a number of excellent tools available to 【practitioners】 for basic screening and tracking of cognitive health. Many of these tools are designed for use with older people, but some are meant for use with younger people as well. The Alzheimer's Association website offers a cognitive assessment toolkit that includes the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit algorithm for the assessment of cognition. This assessment uses patient history, observations by clinicians, and concerns 【raised】 by the patient, family, or caregivers. The toolkit further includes three measures 【validated】 for use by professionals to assess and track a patient's cognitive health. These measures include the General Practitioner Assessment of Cognition, Memory Impairment Screen, and the Mini- Cog brief psychometric test.

101.Push and pull factors. 推拉因素  

People move to a new region for many different reasons. The 【motivation】 for moving can come from a combination of what researchers sometimes call' push and pull 【factors】', those that encourage people to leave a region, and those that attract people to a region. Some of the factors that motivate people to move 【include】 seeking a better climate, finding more affordable housing, looking for work or retiring from work, leaving the 【congestion】 of city living, wanting a more pleasant environment, and wanting to be near to family and friends. In reality, many complex factors and personal reasons may 【interact】 to motivate a person or family to move.

102.Noise Control. 噪音控制  

At the local and state level, demanding funding for repairs and improvement to outdated transit infrastructure will greatly reduce the noise caused by trains, cars, and trucks. Urban- planning approaches to 【eliminating】 noise on a city- by- city basis can be as simple as taking a single lane away from cars and giving it to bicycles, people, or green space. Improving, expanding, and properly funding public transit removes cars from the road, both reducing the sound they 【produce】 and replacing it with quieter options like trams and high- speed light- rail. In architecture, acoustics should play a greater 【role】 in all structures, from mundane apartment buildings to the grandest art museums. Noise control should be a consideration from the very first planning stage, 【rather】 than tacked on as an afterthought.

103.Answer questions. 回答问题  

You have about 30 minutes to answer each question. You must take 【account】 of how many marks are 【available】 for each part when you answer it. Even if you think you can write more, don't spend 15 minutes 【answering】 a part worth only 5 marks. Leave space at the end of your answer and come back to it if you have time to 【spare】 later. And if you can't think of an answer to some part, leave a space and move on to the next part. Don't write about something else if you don't know the correct answer, this is just a 【waste】 of your 【valuable】 【time】 and the examiner's

104.Architectural Museum. 建筑博物馆  

The Edo Tokyo Tatemono En is an open-air architectural museum, but could be better thought of as a park. Thirty buildings from the 19th and early 20th centuries from all around Tokyo were 【restored】 and relocated to the space, where they can be explored by future generations to come. The buildings are a collection of houses and businesses, shops, and bathhouses, 【all】 of which would have been present on a typical middle-class street from Edoera to Showa era Tokyo. The west section is 【residential】, with traditional thatched roof bungalows of the 19th century. Meiji-era houses are also on view, constructed in a more Western style after Japan opened its borders in 1868. The Musashino Sabo Cafe occupies the 【ground】 floor of one such house, where visitors can enjoy a cup of tea. Grand residences like that of Korekiyo Takahashi, an early 20th century politician assassinated over his controversial policies, demonstrate how the upper class lived during that time period. The east section is primarily businesses from the 1920s and" 30s, preserved with their wares on display. Visitors are free to 【wander】 through a kitchenware ship, a florist's an umbrella store, a bar, a soy sauce shop, a tailor's a cosmetics shop, and an inn complete with an operational noodle shop.

105.Opportunity cost. 机会成本  

Opportunity cost incorporates the 【notion】 of scarcity: No matter what we do, there is always a 【trade-off】. We must trade off one thing for another because resources are limited and can be used in different ways. 【By acquiring something】, we use up resources that could have been used to acquire something else. The notion of opportunity cost allows us to measure this trade-off. Most decisions 【involve】 several alternatives. For example, if you spend an hour studying for an economics exam, you have one fewer hour to 【pursue】 other activities. To 【determine】 the opportunity cost of an activity, we look at what you consider the best of these"other" activities. For example, suppose the alternatives to studying economics are studying for a history exam or working in a job that pays 10 per hour. If you consider studying for history a 【better】 use of your time than working, then the opportunity cost of studying economics is the four extra points you could have received on a history exam if you studied history instead of economics. Alternatively, if working is the best alternative, the opportunity cost of studying economics is the 10 you could have earned instead.

106.Primates. 灵长类动物  

With their punk hairstyles and bright colours, marmosets and tamarins are among the most attractive primates on earth. These fast-moving, lightweight animals live in the rainforests of South America. Their small size 【makes】 it easy for them to dart about the trees, catching insects and small animals such as lizards, frogs, and snails. Marmosets have another unusual food 【source】, they use their chisel-like incisor teeth to 【dig】 into tree bark and lap up the gummy sap that seeps out, leaving telltale, oval-shaped holes in the 【branches】 when they have finished. But as vast tracts of rainforest are cleared for plantations and cattle ranches marmosets and tamarins are in serious 【danger】 of extinction.

107.SpaceX. 太空探索技术公司  

SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket lifted off from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on Friday at 18:45 GMT, 14:45 EDT,, reaching 【orbit】 9 minutes later.
The rocket lofted an uncrewed 【mockup】 of SpaceX's Dragon capsule, which is designed to one day carry both crew and cargo to orbit."This has been a good day for SpaceX and a 【promising】 development for the US human spaceflight programme," said Robyn Ringuette of SpaceX in a webcast of the launch.
In a teleconference with the media on Thursday, SpaceX's CEO, Paypal co-founder Elon Musk, said he would consider the flight 100 percent successful if it reached orbit."Even if we prove out just that the first stage functions correctly, I'd still say that's a good day for a test," he said."It's a great day if both stages work correctly."
SpaceX hopes to win a NASA 【contract】 to launch astronauts to the International Space Station using the Falcon 9. US government space shuttles, which currently make these trips, are scheduled to 【retire】 for safety reasons at the end of 2010.

108.History books. 历史书籍  

What history books tell us about the past is not everything that happened, but what historians 【have selected】. They cannot put in everything: choices have to be made. Choices must similarly be made about which aspects of the past should be formally taught to the next generation in the shape of school history lessons. 【So】, for example, when a national school curriculum for England and Wales was first discussed at the end of the 1980s, the history curriculum was the subject of considerable public and media 【interest】. Politicians argued about it; people wrote letters to the press about it; the Prime Minister of the time, Margaret Thatcher, 【intervened】 in the debate. Let us think first about the question of content. There were two main camps on this issue, those who thought the history of Britain should take 【pride】 of 【place】, and those who favoured what was referred to as' world history'.

109.Alchemy. 炼金术  

To learn the speech of alchemy, an early form of chemistry in which people 【attempted】 to turn metals into gold, it helps to think back to a time when there was no science: no atomic number or weight, no periodic chart no list of elements, to the alchemists the 【universe】 was not made of leptons, bosons, gluons, and quarks. Instead, it was made of substances, and one substance, say, walnut oil, could be just as 【pure】 as another, say, silver, even though modern 【scientists】 would say one is heterogeneous and the other homogeneous. Without knowledge of atomic structures, how would it be 【possible】 to tell elements from compounds?

110.Paris. 巴黎  

Paris is very old- there has been a settlement there for at least 6,000 years and its shape has been determined in part by the River Seine, and in part by the 【edicts】 of France's rulers. But the great boulevards we admire today are relatively new, and were constructed to prevent any more barricades 【being created】 by the rebellious population; that work was carried out in the middle 19th century. The earlier Paris had been 【in part】 a maze of narrow streets and alleyways. But you can imagine that the work was not only highly expensive, but caused great distress among the half a million or so whose houses were 【simply】 razed, and whose neighbourhoods disappeared. What is done cannot usually be undone, especially when buildings are 【torn down】.

111.Children sleep patterns. 儿童睡眠模式  

Children have sound sleep patterns. They can 【successfully】 sleep for 8 to 9 hours and get up at a fixed time. But teenagers don't. Their need of an early start to schools or other schedules can 【influence】 their sleep patterns. Despite these factors, they actually need longer sleep. So, parents should try and speak to their children, who are suitable to help them understand that a night of 【sound】 sleep is always helpful.

112.Omniscience. 全知  

Omniscience may be a foible of men, but it is not so of books. Knowledge, as Johnson said, is of two 【kinds】, you may know a thing yourself, and you may know where to find it. Now the amount which you may actually know yourself must, at its best, be limited, but what you may know of the 【sources】 of information may, with proper training, become almost boundless. And here come the 【value】 and use of reference books, the working of one book in connection with another- and applying your own 【intelligence】 to both. By this means we get as near to that omniscient volume which tells everything as ever we shall get, and although the single volume or work which tells everything does not exist, there is a vast number of reference books in existence, a knowledge and proper use of which is essential to every intelligent person. Necessary as I believe reference books to be, they can easily be made to be 【contributory】 to idleness, and too mechanical a use should not be made of them.

113.Australian women novelist. 澳大利亚女性小说家  

In the literary world, it was an accepted assumption that the 1970 s was a time of unprecedented growth in homegrown Australian fiction. And everybody was reading and talking about books by young Australian women.
But it was 【not until recently】 that a researcher was able to measure just how many novels were published in that decade, and she found that there 【had been】 a decline in novels by Australian writers overall, but confirmed an increase in women's novels.
It is this sort of research-testing ideas about literary history, that 【is becoming】 possible with the spread of' Digital Humanities.'
The intersection of Humanities and digital technologies is opening up opportunities in the fields of literature, linguistics, history and language that were not possible without computational methods and digitised resources to 【bring】 information together in an accessible way.
Transcription software is being developed for turning scans of books and documents into text, as the field of digital humanities really 【takes off】.

114.Steven Pinker. 史蒂芬·平克  

Steven Pinker, a cognitive psychologist best known for his book"The Language Instinct" 【has called】 music"auditory cheesecake, an exquisite confection crafted to tickle the sensitive spots of at least six of our mental faculties." If it vanished from our species, he said,"the rest of our lifestyle would be 【virtually】 unchanged." Others have argued that, on the 【contrary】, music, along with art and literature, is part of what makes people human; its absence would have a brutalising effect. Philip Ball, a British science writer and an 【avid】 music enthusiast, comes down somewhere in the middle. He says that music is 【ingrained】 in our auditory, cognitive and motor functions. We have a music instinct as much as a language instinct, and could not rid ourselves of it if we tried.

115.The wholeness of thought. 思维的完整性  

The writer- or, for that matter, the speaker conceives his thought whole, as a unity, but must express it in a line of words; the reader, or listener, must take this line of symbols and from it 【reconstruct】 the original wholeness of thought. There is 【little】 difficulty in conversation, because the listener receives innumerable cues from the physical expressions of the speaker; there is a dialogue, and the listener can 【cut】 in at any time. The advantage of group discussion is that people can overcome linear sequence of words by 【converging】 on ideas from different directions; which makes for wholeness of thought. But the reader is confronted by line upon line of printed symbols, without benefits of physical 【tone】 and emphasis or the possibility of dialogue or discussion.

116.Sustainable transportation system. 可持续交通系统  

A sustainable transportation system is one in which peoples needs and desires for access to jobs, commerce, recreation, culture and home are accommodated using a minimum of resources. Applying principles of 【sustainability】 to transportation will reduce pollution generated by gasoline-powered engines, noise, traffic congestion, land devaluation, urban sprawl, economic segregation, and injury to drivers, pedestrians and cyclists. In addition, the costs of commuting, shipping, housing and goods will be 【reduced】.
Ultimately in a sustainable San Francisco, almost all trips to and 【within】 the City will be on public transit, foot or bicycle, as will a good part of trips to the larger Bay Region. Walking through streets designed for pedestrians and bicycles will be more pleasant than walking through those designed for the automobile. Street-front retail and commercial establishments will 【prosper】 from the large volume of foot traffic drawn to an environment enhanced by trees, appropriately designed"street furniture"" street lights, bicycle racks, benches, and the like, and other people. Rents and property costs will be lowered as land for off-street parking is no 【longer】 required or needed.

117.Instinct in business. 商业直觉  

What is the significance of instinct in business? Does a reliable gut feeling separate winners from losers? And is it the most valuable emotional tool any entrepreneur can possess?
My 【observations】 of successful company owners lead me to believe that a highly analytical attitude can be a drawback. At critical junctures in commercial life, risk-taking is more an 【act】 of faith than a carefully balanced choice. Frequently, such moments require 【decisiveness】 and absolute conviction above all else. There is simply no time to wait for all the facts, or room for doubt. A computer programme cannot tell you how to invent and launch a new product. That 【journey】 involves too many unknowns, too much luck, and too much sheer intuition, rather than the infallible 【logic】 that machines deliver so well. As Chekhov said:"An artist's flair is sometimes worth a scientist's brains" entrepreneurs need right-brain thinking.
When I have been considering whether to buy a company and what price to offer, I have been 【blinded】 too often by reams of due diligence from the accountants and lawyers. Usually, it pays to stand back from such mountains of grey data and weigh up the really important issues, and decide how you feel about the opportunity.

118.Global textile industry. 全球纺织业  

The environmental impact of the global textile industry is hard to overstate. One-third of the water used worldwide is spent fashioning fabrics. For every tonne of cloth 【produced】, 200 tonnes of water is polluted with chemicals and heavy metals. An estimated 1 trillion kilowatt-hours of electricity powers the factories that card and comb, spin and weave, and cut and stitch materials into everything from T-shirts to towels, 【leaving】 behind mountains of solid waste and a massive carbon footprint.
"Where the industry is today is not really sustainable for the long term," says Shreyaskar Chaudhary, chief executive of Pratibha Syntex, a textile manufacturer based outside Indore, India.
With something of an"if you build it, they will come" attitude, Mr. Chaudhary has steered Pratibha 【toward】 the leading edge of eco-friendly textile production. Under his direction, Pratibha began making clothes with organic cotton in 1999. Initially, the company couldn't find enough organic farms growing cotton in central India to 【supply】 its factories. To meet production demands, Chaudhary's team had to convince conventional cotton farmers to change 【their】 growing methods. Pratibha provided seeds, cultivation instruction, and a guarantee of fairtrade prices for their crops. Today, Pratibha has a network of 28,000 organic cotton growers across the central states of Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Orissa.

119.How to make cloth. 布料制作方法  

About 10,000 years ago, people learned how to make cloth. Wool, 【cotton】, flax, or hemp was first spun into a thin thread, using a spindle. The thread was then woven into a fabric. The earliest weaving machines 【probably】 consisted of little more than a pair of sticks that held a set of parallel threads, called the wrap, while the cross-thread, called the weft was inserted. Later machines called looms had roads that separated the threads to allow the weft to be inserted more 【easily】, a piece of wood, called the shuttle, holding a spool of thread, was passed between the separated threads. The basic 【principles】 of spinning and weaving have stayed the same until the present day. Though during the Industrial Revolution of the 18th century, many ways were found of 【automating】 the processes. With new machines such as the spinning mule, many threads could be spun at the same time, and, with the help of devices like the flying shuttle, broad pieces of cloth could be woven at great speed.

120.Distance learning. 远程学习  

Distance learning can be highly beneficial to a large variety of people from young students wanting to expand their horizons to adults looking for more job security, with programmes that allow learners of all ages to take courses for fun, personal advancement and degrees, distance learning can 【meet】 the needs of a diverse population.
Perhaps one of the most notable and often talked about 【advantages】 of distance learning is the flexibility. The majority of programmes allow students to learn when and where it's convenient for them. For 【those】 who are struggling to balance their distance learning goals with working a fulltime job and taking care of a family this kind of flexibility can allow many people to 【pursue】 education who would not otherwise be able to do so. 【Since】 there are no on-campus courses to attend, students can learn from their own homes, at work on their lunch breaks and from virtually anywhere with internet access. For some it can even be a big source of savings on the fuel costs and time required to commute to classes.

121.Criminal acts. 犯罪行为  

The narrative of law and order is located fundamentally at the level of individual guilt and responsibility. Criminal acts are seen as individual issues of personal responsibility and 【culpability】, to which the state responds by way of policing, 【prosecution】, adjudication and punishment.
This is but one level at which crime and criminal justice can be analysed. The problem is that so often analysis ends there, at the level of individual action, 【characterised】 in terms of responsibility, guilt, evil.
In few other areas of social life does individualism have this hold. To take but one 【instance】, it would be absurd to 【restrict】 analysis of obesity, to individual greed. It should similarly be widely seen as absurd to restrict analysis of criminal justice issues to the culpability of individuals.

122.Psychology. 心理学  

Psychology as a subject of study has largely developed in the West since the late nineteenth century. During this period there has been an emphasis on scientific thinking. Because of this 【emphasis】, there have been many scientific studies in psychology which 【explore】 different aspects of human nature. These include studies into how biology, physical factors, influence human experience, how people use their 【senses】, touch, taste, smell, sight and hearing, to get to know the world, how people develop, why people behave in certain ways, how memory works, how people develop language, how people 【understand】 and think about the world, what motivates people, why people have emotions and how personality develops. These scientific investigations all contribute to an 【understanding】 of human nature.
What do we mean by the practical applications of these studies? An understanding of psychology is useful in many different areas in life, such as education, the workplace, social services and medicine. This means that people who have knowledge of psychology can 【use】 or apply that knowledge in areas such as the ones listed above.

123.Material culture studies. 物质文化研究  

The study of objects constitutes a relatively new field of academic inquiry, commonly referred to as material culture studies. Students of material culture seek to understand societies, both past and present, through careful study and 【observation】 of the physical or material objects generated by those societies. The source material for study is exceptionally wide, 【including】 not just human-made artefacts but also natural objects and even preserved body parts, as you saw in the film' Encountering a body'.
Some specialists in the field of material culture have made bold claims for its pre-eminence. In certain disciplines, it reigns 【supreme】. It plays a critical role in archaeology, for example, especially in circumstances where written evidence is either patchy or non-existent. 【In such cases】, objects are all scholars have to rely on in forming an understanding of ancient peoples. Even where written documents survive the physical remains of literate cultures often help to provide new and interesting insights into how people once lived and thought, 【as in】 the case of mediaeval and post- mediaeval archaeology. In analysing the physical remains of societies, both past and present, historians, archaeologists, anthropologists and others have been careful to remind us that objects mean different things to different people.

124.Writing style. 写作风格  

Learning to write well in college means learning, or re-learning, how to write clearly and plainly. Now that doesn't mean that plainness is the only good style, or that you should become a 【slave】 to spare, unadorned writing.
Formality and ornateness have their place, and in 【competent】 hands complexity can take us on a dizzying, breathtaking journey. But most students, most of the time should 【strive】 to be sensibly simple to develop a baseline style of short words, active verbs and relatively simple sentence 【conveying】 clear actions or identities. It's faster, it makes arguments easier to follow, it increases the chances a busy reader will bother to pay attention, and it lets you 【focus】 more attention on your moments of rhetorical flourish which I do not advise abandoning altogether.

125.Intractable debt. 棘手债务  

Books and articles highlighting intractable debt, poverty and development abound in both the academic and popular literature. This addition to the debate is both timely and interesting as it subsumes the economic debate to the broader social, political, environmental and institutional context of debt in developing countries. Debt-for-Development Exchanges: History and New Applications is 【intended】 for a wide audience including: academics from a range of disciplines, including accounting and finance; non-Govemment organisations; civil society groups; and, both debtor and creditor governments and public sector organisation. Professor Ross Buckley, author and editor 【has developed】 an international profile in the area of debt relief and this book is the outcome of an Australian Research Council Discovery grant to explore debt, for development mechanisms that relieve debt, improve development outcomes 【from】 aid, are practically and politically attractive to creditors and 【contribute】 to regional security.

126.Technology Calendar. 科技日历  

According to BT's futurologist, Ian Pearson, these are among the developments scheduled for the first few decades of the new millennium' a period of 1, 000 years', when supercomputers will dramatically accelerate progress in all areas of life. Pearson has 【pieced】 together the work of hundreds of researchers around the world to produce a 【unique】 millennium technology calendar that gives the latest dates when we can expect hundreds of key 【breakthroughs】 and discoveries to take place. Some of the biggest developments will be in medicine, including an 【extended】 life expectancy and dozens of artificial organs 【coming】 into use between now and 2040.

127.Life expectancy. 预期寿命  

Life expectancy at birth is one of the most widely used and internationally recognised indicators of population health. It focuses on the length of life 【rather】 than its quality, and provides a useful summary of the general health of the population.
In Australia, life expectancy at birth has improved for both males and females over the years. A boy born in 2008 could expect to live to 79.2 years of age, 【while】 a girl could expect to reach 83.7 years of age. Over the past decade, the 【gap】 between boys' and girls' life expectancy has reduced from 5.6 years in 1998 to 4.5 years in 2008.
Increases in life expectancy occurred over most of the 20th century, resulting 【in】 an increase of over 25 years of life for both men and women. In the first part of the century, improvements in living conditions such as the provision of cleaner water, better sewerage systems and improved housing, coupled with rising incomes and improved health care including initiatives such as mass immunisation, were 【associated】 with a decline in deaths from infectious diseases.

128.Ozone pollution. 臭氧污染  

Clones of an Eastern cottonwood, Populus deltoides, in the Bronx and other city spots grew to double the biomass of clones 【planted】 outside small towns upstate or on Long Island, says Jillian Gregg, now of the Environmental Protection Agency's western-ecology division in Corvallis, Ore. The growth gap comes 【from】 ozone damage, she and her New York colleagues report. Ozone chemists have known that concentrations may spike skyscraper high in city air, but during a full 24 hours, rural trees actually get a higher cumulative ozone exposure from urban pollution that 【blows】 in and lingers. A series of new experiments now shows that this hang-around ozone is the 【overwhelming】 factor in tree growth, the researchers say in the July 10 Nature."This study has profound importance in showing us most vividly that rural areas pay the 【price】 for urban pollution," says Stephen P. Long of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign."This work should be a wake-up call," he adds.

129.Progressive enhancement. 渐进式增强（计算机领域）

Progressive enhancement is a design practise based on the idea that instead of 【designing for】 the least capable browser, or mangling our code to make a site look the same in every browser, we should provide a core set of functionality and information to all users, and then 【progressively enhance】 the appearance and behaviour of the site for users of more capable browsers. It's very productive development practise, 【instead of spending】 hours working out how to add drop shadows to the borders of an element in every browser, we simply use the standards-based approach for browsers that support it and don't even attempt to implement it in browsers that don't. After all, the users of older and less capable browsers won't know what they are missing, 【the biggest challenge】 to progressive enhancement is the belief among developers and clients that websites should look the same in every browser. As a developer, you can simplify your life and dedicate your time to more interesting challenges if you let go of this outdated notion and embrace progressive enhancement.

130.Crime. 犯罪  

Crime is an integral part of everyday life. It is a prominent 【feature】 in the news and is a popular subject for frictional portrayal. Most students commencing legal studies will have some 【experience】 of crime, whether directly, as a victim of crime or indirectly through exposure to media coverage. This means that most offences 【covered】 on the syllabus, such as murder, theft and rape will be familiar terms. This tends to give students the impression that they know more about criminal law than they do about other subjects on the syllabus. This can be a real disadvantage 【in terms of】 the academic study of criminal law because it tends to lead students to rely on preconceived 【notions】 of the nature and scope of the offences and to reach instinctive, but often legally inaccurate, conclusions. It is absolutely 【essential】 to succeed in criminal law that you put aside any prior knowledge of the offences and focus on the principles of law derived from statutes and cases. 【By】 doing this, you will soon appreciate just how much difference there is between everyday conceptions of crime and its actuality.

131.Maternal employment. 母亲就业  

Affordable early years education and childcare potentially enables parents, particularly mothers, to be in paid employment. International studies 【have found】 that countries with greater 【enrolment】 rates in publicly funded or provided childcare also have higher maternal employment rates, although untangling causal relationships is complex. From the point of view of the household, additional income, especially for the less well- off, is itself associated with better outcomes for children, as child poverty 【has been shown】 to be a key independent determinant of children's outcomes. From the point of view of the public purse, as mothers 【enter】 employment, they are likely to claim fewer benefits and to generate extra revenues 【through】 income tax.

132.Daniel Harris. 丹尼尔·哈里斯  

Daniel Harris, a scholar of consumption and style, has observed that until photography finally 【supplanted】 illustration as the"primary means of advertising clothing" in the 1950s, glamour inhered 【less】 in the face of the drawing, which was by necessity schematic and generalised, than in the sketch's 【attitude】, posture, and gestures, especially in the strangely dainty positions of the hands. Glamour once resided so emphatically in the stance of the model that the faces in the illustrations cannot really be said to have 【expressions】 at all, but angles or tilts. The chin raised upwards in a haughty look; the eyes lowered in an attitude of introspection; the head cocked at an inquisitive or coquettish angle: or the profile presented in sharp outline, emanating power the severity like an emperor's bust 【embossed】 on a Roman coin.

133.Language. 语言  

Language comes so naturally to us that it is easy to forget what a strange and miraculous gift it is. All over the world members of our 【species】 fashion their breath into hisses and hums and squeaks and pops and listen to others do the 【same】. We do this, of course, not only because we like the sounds but because details of the sounds contain information about the 【intentions】 of the person making them. We, humans, are fitted with a means of 【sharing】 our ideas, in all their unfathomable vastness. When we listen to speech, we can be led to think thoughts that have never been thought before and that never would have 【occurred】 to us on our own.

134.AVG. 平均（或指AVG杀毒软件）  

Currently, there is concern about the increasing amount of time children spend 【engaged】 in sedentary activities, the number of children who fail to achieve 【minimum】 daily physical activity guidelines"i.e. 60 min of moderate, to vigorous intensity activities every day", and the apparent increase in obesity prevalence as a result of such sedentary 【behaviour】. Screen-based activities, including television viewing and playing computer games are among the most frequently observed sedentary activities that children partake with children spending 2.5-4h per day participating in such activities. The introduction of"active video games""AVGs" into the gaming market presents an opportunity to convert traditional, sedentary screen-time in to active screen-time and thus increase total daily energy expenditure"EE". Modern AVGs utilise cameras and motion sensors to allow the gamer to physically perform a variety of actions, 【dependent】 on the console, such as swinging a tennis racquet or running. The most demanding AVGs provided similar responses to walking and, based on international standards, should be classified as low-intensity activities. Whilst AVGs may provide children with a better alternative to sedentary gaming, they are not a sufficient 【replacement】 for normal physical activity, e.g. sports and outdoor play.

135.Global heating. 全球变暖  

Three degrees does not sound like much, but it 【represents】 a rise in temperature compared with the global heating that occurred between the last ice age, some 15,000 years ago, and the warmth of the eighteenth century. When Earth was cold, giant glaciers sometimes extended from the polar regions as far south as St Louis in the US and the Alps in Europe. Later this century when it is three degrees hotter glaciers everywhere will be melting in a climate of often 【unbearable】 heat and drought, 【punctuated】 with storms and floods. The 【consequences】 for humanity could be truly horrific; if we fail to act swiftly, the full impact of the plants and animals with whom we share Earth. In a worst case scenario, there might- in the twenty-second century, be only a remnant of humanity eking out a 【diminished】 existence in the polar regions and the few remaining oases left on a hot and arid Earth.

136.Sigmund Freud. 西格蒙德·弗洛伊德  

That Sigmund Freud became a major intellectual presence in twentieth-century culture is not in doubt. 【Nor】 is there any doubt that at all times there was both fervent enthusiasm over and bitter hostility to his ideas and influence. But the exact means 【by which】 Freud became, despite this hostility, a master of intellectual life, on a par, already in the 1920s, with Karl Marx, Albert Einstein, Marie Curie and Bertrand Russell, has not been sufficiently 【explored】. Strikingly, Freud emerged as a twentieth-century icon without the endorsement and support 【of】 an institution or a profession, in contrast to Einstein, Curie and Russell. Where are we to look for the details of this story of an emergent- and new-figure of immense cultural authority? One of the principal aims of this book is to show how this happened in one local, parochial yet privileged, site-Cambridge, then as now a university town stranded in the English Fens with a relatively small 【fluctuating】 population.

137.Music class. 音乐课  

---

138.Vice-chancellor. 副校长  

This is a challenging time for UK students, and we should be making their transition from university to the globalised world easier, not harder. The British Academy has voiced its 【concern】 over the growing language deficit for some years, and the gloomy statistics speak for themselves. We need 【decisive】 action if we are remedying this worsening situation. The 【roots】 of the problem lie within schools, but Vice-Chancellors have the power to drive change and help their students recognise the importance of learning languages, and about the countries where they are spoken and the cultures they 【sustain】. We 【urge】 them to act and protect this country's long term economic, social and cultural standing.

139.Economists' Views. 经济学家的观点  

An economist sees the world basically through a typical micro- economic 【toolkit】. That involves things like thinking at the margin, rationality, opportunity cost, trade- offs. Economists like any other 【discipline】, or dogma has its own jargon and its own rules, and its own way of seeing the world. So basically economics, or economists in general tend to apply micro- economic 【concepts】 like that to explain the way humans behave and to make 【predictions】 about the future.

140.Number and form. 数字与形式  

Number and form are the essence of our world: from the patterns of the stars to the pulses of the market, from the 【beats】 of our hearts to catching a ball or tying our shoelaces. Drawing on science, literature, history and philosophy, and introducing 【geniuses】 from Alcibiades, the enfant terrible of Athens, to Gauss, the Mozart of numbers, this 【inspiring】 book makes the mysteries of maths accessible and its rich 【patterns】 brilliantly clear.

141.Delegation. 代表团  

The process of delegation comprises the decision to delegate, the briefing, and the follow-up. At each of these points, 【anticipate】 the potential problems. When you delegate, you are not delegating the right to perform an 【action】, you are delegating the right to make 【decisions】. It is important to be 【flexible】, as the person to whom you delegate may have a better and faster way of completing a job than you. 【Overall】 responsibility for a delegated task remains with you. It is helpful to others if you can provide 【constructive】 feedback on their performance.

142.Promoting good customer service. 促进优质客户服务  

Promoting good customer service must start at the top. If management doesn't realise how important this 【aspect】 of their business is, they will be at an instant 【disadvantage】 in their industry. Good customer response equates to loyal customers, which are the cornerstone of any successful business. No matter how much money you invest in your 【marketing】, if you don't much have the fundamental elements of your business right, it's 【wasted】 money.

143.Choice of Investments. 投资选择  

Men and women are making different choices about their retirement savings, which could lead to very different investment outcomes, according to Dr Claire Matthews, Director of Financial Planning at Massey University's Center for Banking Studies. Speaking at the 2012 New Zealand Finance Colloquium, held at Massey University's Albany campus last week, Dr Matthews said demographic characteristics had a substantial impact on the choices people made about KiwiSaver funds and retirement savings more generally. 【When it came to】 fund selection, she found there were significant differences based on gender. Men are more likely to invest in aggressive and 【growth】 funds, while women are more likely to choose 【conservative】 funds."Males are risk takers, 【whether】 it's in their choice of car or their investment fund," she says."But when it comes to long-term savings, risk taking can actually be an advantage." Dr Matthews also found that men are more likely than women to have prior savings when joining KiwiSaver. Just over half of male respondents said they had savings already, while only 38 percent of women did."These figures reflect and confirm, quite disappointingly, the difference between males and females and the level of interest they take in financial planning," Dr Matthews says."It's important for all New Zealanders to be better educated about their personal finances, but this is particularly so for women." Other demographic factors, including age, ethnicity, education, and income, can also influence the choices 【being】 made about retirement savings. Dr Matthews found that those with bachelor and higher degrees, and those in households with a pre-tax income of 100,000 or more, were more likely to choose aggressive and growth funds.
【On the other hand】, both the youngest and oldest age groups were more likely to be invested in conservative funds. While this might be appropriate for the life-cycle stage of older investors, it might not be so appropriate for younger, longer-term investors.

144.Business. 商业  

One distinguishing feature of business is its economic character. In the world of business, we interact with each other not as family members, friends, or neighbours, but as 【buyers】 and 【sellers】, employers and employees, and the like. Trading, for example, is often 【accompanied】 by hard bargaining, in which both sides conceal their full hand and perhaps 【engage】 in some bluffing. And a 【skilled】 salesperson is 【well-versed】 in the art of arousing a customer's attention sometimes by a bit of puffery to 【clinch】 the sale. Still, there is an"ethics of trading" that prohibits the use of false or deceptive claims and tricks such as"bait-and-switch" advertising.

145.Politics and international relations. 政治与国际关系  

This course provides students with an in-depth understanding of the exciting disciplines of politics and international relations. Students will learn about the 【workings】 of political institutions in countries around the world and explore the complex field of relations between nations. Topics in governance, public policy, public administration, national security and border control ensure that students receive a 【broad】 and current education in the range of issues which are covered under the label of politics and international relations. Students will undertake four compulsory units and two majors, one in politics and international relations and the other in governance and policy. They will also 【choose】 an elective major from a wide choice of 【options】 including political communication, international studies, international business and national security studies. In addition to acquiring specialist 【knowledge】 and competencies in Politics and International Relations and Commerce, students will graduate with a range of generic skills such as critical thinking, enhanced communication abilities, problem-solving and 【strong】 capacities to work with others. They will also develop ethically based and socially 【responsible】 attitudes and behaviours.

146.Favorable Traits. 有利特质  

New favourable traits evolve when genetic mutations arise that offer a survival edge. As the survivors of each generation pass on those beneficial mutations, the mutations and 【their】 adaptive traits become more common in the general population. Though it may take millions of years for complex traits 【to evolve】, say allowing humans to walk on two legs, evolution itself happens with each generation as adaptive mutations become more frequent in the population. The genomic revolution has allowed biologists to see the natural selection process 【in action】 by making the genetic blueprint of hundreds of thousands of people available for comparison. By tracking the relative rise and fall of specific mutations 【across】 generations of people, researchers can infer which traits are spreading or dwindling.

147.SWIMS. 游泳（或SWIMS系统）  

Understanding the number of species we have in our marine environment is a 【basic】 need if we are to protect and conserve our biodiversity. This is 【vital】 in today's rapidly changing world, not just here in Hong Kong, but 【especially】 in Southeast Asia which holds the world's most diverse marine habitats. SWIMS is playing a major role in trying to measure and conserve these important resources, both within Hong Kong but also, together with its regional collaborators, in Southeast Asia."said Professor Grey A. Williams, the leader of this study and the Director of HKU SWIMS. The enormous 【array】 of marine life in Hong Kong, however, has yet to receive its desirable level of conservation as currently only less than 2 percent of Hong Kong's marine area is protected as marine parks or reserve as compared with approximately 40 percent of our terrestrial area. The Government has committed to designate more new marine parks in the coming years. The Brothers Marine Park in the northern Lantau waters 【will be launched】 soon, which will bring Hong Kong's total protected marine area to more than 2 percent. The research team welcomed the initiative of the new marine park 【while】 also urging the Hong Kong government to move towards the global target of at least 10% marine protected area by the year 2020 under United Nation's Convention on Biological Diversity" CBD"

148.Fresh water. 淡水  

Everybody needs fresh water. 【Without】 water, people, animals and plants cannot live. Although a few plants and animals can make do with saltwater, all humans need a 【constant】 supply of fresh water if they are to stay 【fit】 and healthy. Of the total supply of water on the Earth, only about 3 percent of it is fresh, and most of that is stored as ice and snow at the poles, or is so 【deep】 under the surface of the Earth that we cannot get to it. Despite so much of the water being out of reach, we still have a million cubic miles of it that we 【can】 use. That's about 4, 300, 000 cubic kilometres of fresh water to share out between most of the plants, animals and people on the planet.

149.Effective leaders. 高效领导者  

In search of lessons to 【apply】 in our own careers, we often try to 【emulate】 what effective leaders do. Roger Martin says this focus is misplaced, because moves that work in one context may make little sense in another. A more productive, though more difficult, approach is to look at how such leaders 【think】. After extensive interviews with more than 50 of them, the author discovered that most are 【integrative】 thinkers, that is, they can hold in their heads two opposing ideas at once and then come up with a new idea that contains elements of 【each】 but is superior to both.

150.What Will Make You Happy. 什么会让你快乐  

Want to know what will make you happy? Then ask a total stranger or so says a new study from Harvard University, which shows that another persons experience is often more 【informative】 than your own best guess. The study, which appears in the current issue of Science, was led by Daniel Gilbert, professor of psychology at Harvard and author of the 2007 bestseller stumbling on Happiness, along with Matthew Killingsworth and Rebecca Eyre, also of Harvard, and Timothy Wilson of the University of Virginia. If you want to know how much you will enjoy an experience, you are better off knowing how much someone else enjoyed it than knowing anything about the experience itself says Gilbert." Rather than closing our eyes and 【imagining】 the future, we should examine the experience of those who have been there. Previous research in psychology, neuroscience, and behavioural economics 【has shown】 that people have difficulty predicting what they will like and how much they will like it, which 【leads】 them to make a wide variety of poor decisions. Interventions aimed at 【improving】 the accuracy with which people imagine future events have been generally unsuccessful.

151.Interior design. 室内设计  

Interior design is a 【professionally】 conducted, practice-based process of planning and realisation of interior spaces and the elements within. Interior design is 【concerned】 with the function and operation of the aesthetics and its 【sustainability】. The work of an interior designer draws upon many other 【disciplines】, such as environmental psychology, architecture, product design and, aesthetics, 【in relation to】 a wide range of building spaces including hotels corporate and public spaces, schools, hospitals, private residences, shopping malls, restaurants, theatres and airport terminals.

152.Two sentiments. 两种情绪  

Over the last ten thousand years there seem to have been two separate and conflicting building sentiments throughout the history of towns and cities. 【One】 is the desire to start again, for a variety of reasons: an earthquake or a tidal wave may have demolished the settlement, or fire destroyed it, or the new city 【marks】 a new political beginning. The other can be likened to the effect of a magnet: established settlements attract people, who 【tend】 to come whether or not there is any planning for their arrival. The clash between these two sentiments is evident in every established city 【unless】 its development has been almost completely accidental or is lost in history. Incidentally, many settlements have been planned from the beginning but, for a variety of reasons, no settlement followed the plan. A good example is Currowan, on the Clyde River in New South Wales, which 【was surveyed】 in the second half of the 19th century, in expectation that people would come to establish agriculture and a small port. But no one came.

153.Platypus. 鸭嘴兽  

The platypus looks like no other creature on Earth. Physically, it appears to be a hybrid blend of a bird, beaver, reptile and otter, with additional characteristics not contained in any of these four. On cursory examination, the platypus has a bill that most 【resembles】 that of a waterfowl, not the mouth of any known mammal. Yet it is not an ordinary bill. It is actually a well-designed sensory organ. Not a nose, but a highly sensitive electro-location sensor, detecting miniscule electrical impulses generated by its food source of small crustaceans and worms. No other mammal has a sensor so highly 【developed】, in fact; only one other mammal has this ability at all. Then 【there】 are the webbed feet, similar to those found on otters. Unlike an otter, however, the webbing is far more pronounced on the front feet of the platypus, which it uses like paddles for swimming. 【While】 in the water, the back feet are tucked into its body and hardly used at all.

154.Complementary therapies. 辅助疗法  

Complementary therapies, such as those 【practised】 by naturopaths, chiropractors, and acupuncturists, have become increasingly popular in Australia over the last few 【decades】. Interest initially coincided with 【enthusiasm】 for alternative lifestyles, while immigration and increased contact and trade with China have also had an 【influence】. The status of complementary therapies is being re-visited in a number of areas: legal regulation; the stances of doctors' associations; their inclusion in medical education; and scientific research into their 【efficacy】.

155.Prisoners. 囚犯  

The primary goal for this year- long campaign, founded by the English lawyer Peter Benenson and a small group of writers, academics and lawyers including Quaker peace activist Eric Baker, was to identify individual prisoners of conscience around the world and then campaign for their release. In early 1962, the campaign had received enough public support to become a permanent organisation and was 【renamed】 Amnesty International. Under British law, Amnesty International was classed as a political organisation and therefore excluded from tax- free charity status. To work around this, the"Fund for the Persecuted" was established in 1962 to receive donations to support prisoners and their families. The name was later changed to the"Prisoners of Conscience Appeal Fund" and is now a separate and independent charity which provides relief and 【rehabilitation】 grants to prisoners of conscience in the UK and around the world. Amnesty International has, since its founding, pressured governments to release those persons it considers to be prisoners of conscience. Governments, conversely, tend to deny that the specific prisoners identified by Amnesty International are, in fact, being held on the grounds Amnesty claims; they allege that these prisoners pose 【genuine】 threats to the security of their countries. The concept of"Prisoners of conscience" became a controversy around Nelson Mandela's 【imprisonment】.

156.Breast-feeding. 母乳喂养  

hile many mothers- to- be are advised about the 【benefits】 of breastfeeding, what they may not be told is that the effects go well beyond physical health. A new study finds babies breastfed for long periods have better performance on intelligence tests, greater school achievement, and higher monthly incomes as 30- year- olds. While past research has found higher intelligence 【scores】 among breastfed babies, what is so significant about this study is that the researchers were able to collect more complete information on breastfeeding duration and also followed for a longer period. And, by using a population- based birth 【cohort】, the breast feeding practises had no association 【with】 income level. Most of the evidence of higher intelligence test scores among breastfed babies comes from high- income countries, where middle- class and higher- class mothers are more likely to breastfeed their babies than lower income mothers- certainly in the United States, breastfeeding rates 【reflect】 this trend. With evidence coming from first- world countries' Where breastfeeding is positively associated with higher socioeconomic status'. Horta explained,' There is always a question of whether the effect that has been observed in other studies is a consequence of breastfeeding by itself or has the result been 【confounded】 by socioeconomic status.' Specifically, higher income babies are most likely eating better quality food and this could be impacting IQ test scores.

157.Descendants of the Maya. 玛雅后裔  

Descendants of the Maya living in Mexico still sometimes refer to themselves as the 【corn】 people. The phrase is not intended as 【metaphor】. Rather, it's meant to 【acknowledge】 their abiding dependence on this miraculous grass, the 【staple】 of their diet for almost nine thousand years. Forty percent of the calories a Mexican eats in a day comes directly from corn, most of it in the form of tortillas. So when a Mexican says I am maize or corn walking, it is simply a statement of fact: The very substance of the Mexicans body is to a considerable extent a 【manifestation】 of this plant.

158.Good school. 好学校  

A big rise in state schools rated among the best institutions in the country is revealed in the latest edition of the Good Schools Guide. Middle-class parents facing financial pressures in the 【downturn】 are increasingly looking beyond the private sector to educate their children. The 23-year-old Good Schools Guide, a 【popular】 reference book for fee-paying families set on the best private school, 【has increased】 the number of state schools in this year's edition to 251, pushing the figure to more than a quarter of its 1, 000 entries for the first time, 【explaining】 why the guide has more than doubled the number of schools it features outside the private sector in only five years, Sue Fieldman, regional editor, told the Financial Times:"The parents we speak to want more information on the state 【sector】 and the best it has to offer."

159.High-protein diet. 高蛋白饮食  

In our studies, those people on a high- protein diet lost the same amount of weight as those on a higher- carbohydrate diet, since the two diets 【offered】 an equal amount of kilojoules and the same amount of fat. However, body composition, that is, the 【ratio】 of fat to muscle, showed greater improvement among those people on the higher- protein diet. When the 【participants】 in other studies were allowed to eat until they were no longer hungry, those on the higher protein diet lost more weight than those on the higher carbohydrate diet, even after more than a year. The reduction in hunger and the beneficial effect on muscle provided by the higher-protein diet is mostly related to its protein content, while the reduced triglyceride levels and enhanced fat- loss seem to be related to its lower amounts of carbohydrate. The diet is healthy because its protein comes from lean red meat, fish, chicken and low- fat dairy products, all of which 【provide】 good nutrition. A high- protein diet in which the protein comes from protein powders and supplements is unlikely to be healthy, unless the supplements are 【fortified】 with vitamins and minerals.

160.People need exercise. 人们需要锻炼  

One thing is certain. Most people do not get enough exercise in their 【daily】 routines. All of the advances of modem technology, from 【electric】 can openers to power steering, have made life easier, more comfortable and 【much】 less physically 【demanding】. Yet our bodies need activity, especially if they are carrying around too much fat. Satisfying this need requires a sustainable plan, and a commitment. There are two 【main】 ways to increase the number of calories you expand: Start a regular exercise programme if you do not have one already. Increase the amount of physical activity in your daily routine.

161.Teens writing. 青少年写作  

Teens write for a variety of reasons, as part of a school assignment, to 【get】 a good grade, 【to stay】 in touch with friends, to share their artistic creations with others or simply to put their thoughts to paper, whether virtual or otherwise. In our focus groups, teens said they are motivated to write when they can 【select】 topics that are relevant to their lives and interests, and report greater enjoyment of school writing when they have the opportunity to write creatively. Having teachers or other adults who challenge them, 【present】 them with interesting curricula and give them detailed feedback also serves as a motivator for teens. Teens also 【report】 writing for an audience motivates them to write and write well.

164.Natural capital. 自然资本  

Capital has often been thought of narrowly as physical capital, the machines, tools, and equipment used in the production of other goods, but our wealth and wellbeing also 【relies】 on natural capital. If we forget this, we risk 【degrading】 the services that natural ecosystems provide, which 【support】 our economies and sustain our lives. These services include purifying our water, 【regulating】 our climate, reducing flood risk, and pollinating our crops. The Natural Capital Project- a partnership among WWF, The Nature Conservancy, University of Minnesota and Stanford University- works to provide decision makers with 【reliable】 ways to assess the true value of the services that ecosystems provide. An 【essential】 element of the Natural Capital Project is developing tools that help decision makers protect biodiversity and ecosystem services.

167.Genetic test. 基因检测  

While Florey researchers have also created a genetic test for PD, 10 percent of PD cases are caused by genetic factors, this new test has a broader 【application】 by screening for many different types of PD and monitoring treatment, as well as measuring the effectiveness of drugs being developed to treat the disease. Dr Qiaoxin Li and colleagues from The University of Melbourne and The Mental Health Research Institute of Victoria, along with Prof Malcolm Horne from the Howard Florey Institute, found people with PD had low levels of the brain-secreted protein' alpha-synuclein' in their blood, 【while】 people without PD had high levels of the protein. Prof Horne said the test they developed measured alpha-synuclein levels in blood."Currently there is no specific PD diagnostic test so doctors rely on their observations to make a diagnosis, which means some patients may not be prescribed the most suitable medication and around 15 percent of those 【diagnosed】 may actually be suffering from something else," Prof Horne said. Further studies are required to establish whether this test can distinguish between people who are responsive to treatment and those who are not," he said. The researchers are now conducting a large-scale study to determine the 【effectiveness】 of the test, to discover whether it is applicable for all types of PD, and to find out if it can measure the rate of 【progression】 and severity of the disease.

168.Hard work. 努力工作  

It is important to 【emphasise】 the need for hard work as an essential part of studying law, because far too many students are tempted to think that they can succeed by relying on what they imagine to be their natural ability, without bothering to add the 【expenditure】 of effort. To take an analogy some people prefer the more or less instant 【gratification】 which comes from watching television adaptation of a classic novel to the rather more 【laborious】 process of reading the novel itself. Those who 【prefer】 watching television to reading the book are less likely to study law successfully, unless they rapidly acquire a 【taste】 for text-based materials.

169.Bees. 蜜蜂  

Bees need two different kinds of food. One is honey made from nectar, which actually is a fluid that is collected in the heart of the flowers to 【encourage】 pollination by insects and other animals. Secondly, come from pollen, it is fine powdery substance in yellow, consisting of microscopic grains 【discharged】 from the male part of a flower or from a male cone. It contains a male gamete that can fertilise the female ovule, which is 【transferred】 by wind, insects or other animals.

170.Sales activities. 销售活动  

Organisations need to integrate their sales activities more both internally and with customers' needs according to a new book co-authored by an academic at the University of East Anglia. The book 【addresses】 how sales can help organisations to become more customer oriented and considers how they are responding to challenges such as increasing competition, more 【demanding】 customers and a more complex selling environment. Many organisations are facing escalating costs and a growth in customer power, 【which】 makes it necessary to allocate resources more strategically. The sales function can provide critical customer and market knowledge to help inform both innovation and marketing. However, the authors say that within the industry 【there】 is still uncertainty about the shape a future sales team should take, how it should be managed, and how it 【fits】 into their organisations business model.

171.Bats. 蝙蝠  

Of the more than 1,000 bat species worldwide, 22 are 【native】 to North America. And while there are no pollinator bats in our area, gardeners should 【champion】 those that do live here, because they're insectivorous. These bats 【consume】 moths, beetles and mosquitoes, and can eat up to 500 mosquito-sized insects per hour. They also protect gardens and crops from such 【pests】 as cucumber beetles, cutworms and leafhoppers.

172.Dark energy. 暗能量  

Arguably the greatest mystery facing humanity today is the prospect that 75 percent of the 【universe】 is made up of a 【substance】 known as"dark energy", about which we have almost no knowledge at all. Since a further 21 percent of the universe is made from invisible"dark matter" that can only be 【detected】 through its gravitational effects, the ordinary matter and energy making up the Earth, planets and stars is apparently only a tiny part of what exists. These 【discoveries】 require a shift in our perception as great as that made after Copernicus's 【revelation】 that the Earth moves around the Sun.

173.Horseman. 骑手

174.ARENA. 竞技场（或ARENA计划）  

The Australian Renewable Energy Agency' ARENA' has awarded 2. 49 million to cover a 【portion】 of the cost of a collaborative project led by the Australian Maritime College at the University of Tasmania, in 【partnership】 with The University of Queensland and CSIRO. The 5. 85 million' Tidal Energy in Australia- Assessing Resource and Feasibility to Australia's Future Energy Mix' project will map the country's tidal energy in 【unprecedented】 detail before assessing its ability to contribute to Australia's energy needs.

175.Poetry. 诗歌  

Throughout history poetry has often been created to celebrate a wedding. This article will examine the ways in 【which】 this has happened at different periods of time and in many widely differing societies. It will look at some examples of wedding poems from a 【range】 of eras and cultures, and will set them in their specific context, drawing out the particular features that 【reflect】 that context. Other writers on this topic have tended to focus on more personal wedding poems, 【those】 dedicated to the bride or the groom. Here, however, the intention is to consider poems that were written with more of a social purpose in mind.

176.Footprint. 足迹  

Hominin The discovery of a set of what look like ancient hominin footprints on the island of Crete throw our understanding of human evolution into disarray. Received wisdom is that after 【splitting】 from the chimp lineage, our hominin ancestors were confined to Africa until around 1.5 million years ago. The prints found in Crete, however, 【belonged】 to a creature that appears to have lived 5.7 million years ago- suggesting a more complex story. More research is needed to confirm what kind of animal made them. However, the prints seem to have been made by a creature that walked upright, on the soles of clawless feet rather than on its toes , with a big toe positioned like our own, rather than sticking out sideways like an ape's It may ye turn out to have been 【previously】 unknown non-hominin that had evolved with a human-like food; but the explanatory paper, in the proceedings of the Geologists's association, is not the first to suggest that hominins could have originated in Europe. A few months ago, a term put forward 【evidence】, gleaned from fossils found in Greece and Bulgaria that a 7.2-million-year-old ape known as Graecopithecus was in fact a hominin.

177.The emperor penguin. 帝企鹅  

The emperor is the giant of the penguin world and the most iconic of the birds of Antarctica. Gold patches on their ears and on the top of their chest brighten up their black heads. Emperors and their closest relative, the king penguin, have unique breeding cycles, with very long chick-rearing periods. The emperor penguins breed the furthest south of any penguin species, forming large colonies on the sea-ice surrounding the Antarctic continent. They are true Antarctic birds, rarely 【seen】 in the subantarctic waters. So that the chicks can fledge in the late summer season, emperors breed during the cold, dark winter, with temperatures as low at minus 50 degrees celsius and winds 【up】 to 200 km per hour. They trek 50- 120 km, 30- 75 mls, over the ice to breeding colonies which may include thousands of individuals. The female lays a single egg in May then passes it over to her mate to incubate 【whilst】 she goes to sea to feed. For nine weeks the male fasts, losing 45% of his body weight. The male balances the egg on his feet, which are 【covered】 in a thick roll of skin and feathers. The egg can be 70 degrees celsius warmer than the outside temperature.

178.Economic inequality. 经济不平等  

For the past thirty years, the United States 【has been】 conducting what one observer Samuelson 2001 has called"a massive social experiment" regarding the political and social consequences of increasing economic inequality. The share of national income going to families in the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution 【declined】 by about one-fifth, from 17.4 percent in 1973 to 13.9 percent in 2001, while the share going to families in the top 5 percent increased by more than one-third, from 15.5 percent to 21.0 percent Mishel, Bernstein, and Boushey 2003. 【Meanwhile】, the share of income going to the top one-tenth of one percent quadrupled between 1970 and 1998, leaving the 13,000 richest families in America with almost as much income as the 20 million poorest families Krugman 2002. The economic causes of these trends, technological change demography global competition, are a matter of some 【scholarly】 controversy. But the important political point is that, whereas most rich democracies have significantly mitigated increasing economic inequality through government action, the United States has mostly been content to let economic trends take their course, doing"less than almost any other rich democracy to 【limit】 economic inequality" through employment and wage policies, taxes, and transfers Jencks 2002, 64.

179.Cardona salt mountain. 卡多纳盐山  

Formed two million years ago when low-density salt was pushed up through the much harder materials surrounding it, the Cardona Salt Mountain is one of the largest domes of its kind in the world, and unique in Europe. While small amounts of other minerals pervade the savoury hill, the salt pile 【would have】 a near translucent quality if not for the thin layer of reddish clay coating the exterior. The 【significance】 of the mountain was recognised as early as the middle ages when Romans began exploiting the mountain for its salt, which began to bolster the young Cardonian 【economy】. With the invention of industrial mining techniques, a mine was built into the side of the mountain and a thriving facility formed at its base as excavators dragged enormous amounts of potash, water-soluble, salt from the innards of the hill. 【In addition】 to the mineral export, the locals of Cardona began making salt sculptures to sell and invented a number of hard, salty pastries unique to the area.

180.Global leadership. 全球领导力  

Education for Global Leadership: The Importance of International Studies and Foreign Language Education for U.S. Economic and National Security Committee for Economic Development. To confront the twenty-first century challenges to our economy and national security, our education system must 【be strengthened】 to increase the foreign language skills and cultural awareness of our students. America's continued global leadership will depend on our students' abilities to 【interact】 with the world community both inside and outside our borders.

181.The Romans. 罗马人  

Over many centuries and across many territories the Romans were able to win an astonishing number of military victories and their success was due to several important factors. Italy was a peninsula not easily attacked. 【There was】 a huge pool of fighting men to draw upon, a disciplined and innovative army, a centralised command and line of supply, expert engineers, effective diplomacy 【through】 a network of allies, and an inclusive approach to conquered peoples, 【which】 allowed for the strengthening and broadening of the Roman power and logistical bases. 【Further】, her allies not only supplied, equipped and paid for additional men but they also supplied vital materials such as grain and ships. 【On top of all】 this, Rome was more or less in a continuous state of war or readiness for it and believed absolutely in the necessity of defending and imposing on others what she firmly believed was her cultural superiority.

183.Superintelligence. 超级智能  

A superintelligence is any intellect that is vastly outperforms the best human brains in practically every field, including scientific creativity, general wisdom, and social skills. This definition leaves open how the superintelligence 【is implemented】, it could be in a digital computer, an ensemble of networked computers, cultured cortical tissue, or something else. On this definition, Deep Blue is not a superintelligence, since it is only smart within one narrow domain chess, and even there it is not vastly superior 【to】 the best humans. Entities such as corporations or the scientific community are not superintelligences either. Although they can perform a number of intellectual feats of which no individual human is capable, they are not 【sufficiently】 integrated to count as"intellects", and there are many fields 【in which】 they perform much worse than single humans. For example, you cannot have a real-time conversation with"the scientific community".

184.Symbiosis. 共生  

Symbiosis is a general term for 【interspecific】 interactions in which two species live together in a long- term, 【intimate】 association. In everyday life, we sometimes use the term symbiosis to mean a relationship that 【benefits】 both parties. However, in ecologist- speak, symbiosis is a broader concept and can include 【close】, lasting relationships with a variety of positive or negative effects on the participants.

185.Professor Tamsin Ford. 塔姆辛·福特教授  

The How I Feel About My School Questionnaire, designed by experts at the University of Exeter Medical School, is 【available】 to download for free. It 【uses】 emoticon-style faces with options of happy, ok or sad. It asks children to rate how they feel in seven situations including on the way to school, in the classroom and in the playground. It is 【designed】 to help teachers and others to 【communicate】 with very young children on complex emotions. The project was supported by the National Institute for Health Research Collaboration for Applied Health Research and Care South West Peninsula"NIHR PenCLAHRC". Professor Tamsin Ford, Professor of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the University of Exeter Medical School, 【led】 the design, involving children to give feedback on which style of questionnaire they could relate to best. She said:"When we're 【carrying】 out research in schools, it can be really hard to meaningfully assess how very young children are feeling. We couldn't find anything that could provide what we needed, so we decided to create something."

187.A mini helicopter. 微型直升机  

A mini helicopter modeled on flying tree seeds could soon be flying overhead. Evan Ulrich and colleagues at the University of Maryland in College Park 【turned to】 the biological world for inspiration to build a scaled-down helicopter that could mimic the properties of full-size aircraft. The complex design of full-size helicopters gets less efficient when shrunk, meaning that standard mini helicopters expend most of their power simply fighting to stay stable in the air. The researchers realised that a simpler aircraft designed to stay stable passively would use much less power and reduce manufacturing costs to boot. It turns out that nature 【had beaten】 them to it. The seeds of trees such as the maple have a single-blade structure that allows them to fly far away and drift safely to the ground. These seeds, known as samaras, need no engine to 【spin】 through the air, thanks to a process called autorotation. By analysing the behaviour of the samara with high-speed cameras, Ulrich and his team were able to copy its 【design】. The samara copter is not the first single-winged helicopter- one was flown in 1952, and others have been attempted since- but it is the first to take advantage of the samara's autorotation. This 【allows】 Ulrich's vehicle to perform some neat tricks, such as falling safely to the ground if its motor fails or using vertical columns of air to stay aloft indefinitely."We can turn off the motor and autorotate, which requires no power to sustain," says Ulrich.

188.Ministerial Staff. 部长级工作人员  

The contemporary ministerial staffing system is large, active and partisan- far larger and further evolved than any Westminster equivalent. Ministers' demands for help to cope with the pressures of an increasingly competitive and professionalised political environment have been key drivers of the staffing system's development. But there has not been commensurate growth in 【arrangements】 to support and control it. The 【operating】 framework for ministerial staff is 【fragmented】 and ad hoc.

189.Darwin theory. 达尔文理论  

DNA is a 【molecule】 that does two things. First, it acts as the 【hereditary】 material, which is passed down from generation to generation. Second, it directs, to a considerable extent, the construction of our bodies, telling our cells what kinds of molecules to make and 【guiding】 our development from a single-celled zygote to a fully formed adult. These two things are of course 【connected】. The DNA sequences that construct the best bodies are more likely to get passed down to the next generation because well-constructed bodies are more likely to survive and 【thus】 to reproduce. This is Darwin's theory of natural selection stated in the language of DNA.

190.Human remains. 人类遗骸  

In 1959, the partial skeletal remains of an ancient woman estimated to be 10,000 years old were unearthed in Arlington Springs on Santa Rosa Island, one of the eight Channel Islands off the southern California coast. They were discovered by Phil C. Orr, curator of anthropology and natural history at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History. The remains of the so-called Arlington Springs woman were recently reanalyzed by the 【latest】 radiocarbon dating techniques and were found to be approximately 13,000 years old. The new date makes her remains older than any other known human skeleton found 【so far】 in North America.
The discovery 【challenges】 the popular belief that the first colonists to North America arrived at the end of the last ice age about 11,500 years ago by 【crossing】 a Bering land bridge that connected Siberia to Alaska and northwestern Canada. The earlier date and the location of the woman's remains on the island add weight to an alternative theory that some early settlers 【may】 have constructed boats and migrated from Asia by sailing down the Pacific coast.

191.Granular material. 颗粒材料  

Part of the fun of experimenting with granular materials, says Stephen W. Morris, is the showmanship. In one stunt that he has demonstrated in settings ranging from high school classrooms to television studios, the University of Toronto 【physicist】 loads clear plastic tubes with white table salt and black sand and starts them rotating. What transpires in the tubes usually knocks the socks off of any 【unsuspecting】 bystander. Instead of mixing into a drab grey sameness, the sand particles slowly separate into crisp black bands cutting across a long, narrow field of salt. As the spinning continues, some bands disappear and new ones arise."It's a parlour trick," Morris says. Not to deny its entertainment value, this 【demonstration】 of how strangely granular materials can behave is also an 【authentic】 experiment in a field both rich in fundamental physics and major practical consequences.
Yet granular mixing today remains more of an art than a 【science】, says chemical engineer Fernando J. Muzzio of Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N. J.. Scientists are often at a loss to explain why grains assume surprising patterns instead of simply mixing uniformly. Most industrial-mixing processes are devised by trial and error.

192.Motorcyclist Accident. 摩托车手事故  

May 15, 2008 When motorcyclists have an accident they roll a dice, with escaping 【unscathed】 on one side and very severe consequences on the other. And for those unlucky enough to 【sustain】 severe and permanent injuries like paraplegia, there's often one huge regret- that they may never ride again on a real bike. A chance encounter with a paraplegic ex- motorcross champion in a hospital carpark inspired West Australian Darren Lomman to put together an audacious project: a motorcycle for paraplegic riders- and his working prototype, a heavily modified Honda CBR 250 RR, is now road licenced and 【operational】. With the right investment and profile, Lomman believes the Dreamfit bike isn't too far away from production potential- and after around 150 enquiries from all around the world, he would love to be able to put the bikes in the hands of more people for whom riding has become an impossible dream. Started as a university project, the Dreamfit CBR 250 RR has been modified to 【suit】 riders paralysed from the chest down, with thumb- activated pneumatic rams for foot- free gear shifting, a combined braking system, custom- moulded ergonomic cups to hold the rider in place without any lower body strength, and a set of steel- braced"landing gear" wheels that drop to provide stability at very low speeds.

193.Museum. 博物馆  

The best way to experience the museum is from the top floor down. One emerges from the elevators into a spacious hallway. At some hours, museum staff members are giving small hands-on 【demonstrations】 of techniques such as quillwork. These activities take place near wall cases filled with objects. These small surveys of the museum's vast holdings are called"Windows on the Collection." Appearing on every floor in the halls that 【overlook】 the rotunda, these display cases serve as a kind of visible storage, presenting a panoply of objects and materials. Their arrangements are artistic, and their contents perhaps 【intentionally】 designed to jar the visitor. For example, the largest case on the fourth floor displays animal imagery of all sorts. Older sculptures of birds, mammals and sea creatures 【appear】 alongside witty contemporary works such as Larry Beck's version of a Yup'ik mask made of rubber tyre treads and metal tools, and Jim Schoppert's"Walrus Loves Baby Clams" mask. Recently-made ivory carvings challenge the common distinction between so-called"authentic fine art" and commodity, a distinction which may be passe in the academic world, but which still 【holds】 strong among much of the general public.

194.Students run restaurant. 学生经营的餐厅  

The rest of Taylor's restaurant is student-run. Students in quantity food production and service management 【classes】 make the articulate and detailed dishes."We teach students to understand where a product comes from and to respect that product," Garmy said. Sceptics might doubt the 【quality】 of a student-run restaurant, but one visit to Taylor's will immediately change their outlook. Dishes such as orecchiette and butternut squash, pappardelle with duck and bistro chicken will please any appetite while imparting the need to 【return】 for a second taste. Students are taught to use ratios and proportions rather than recipes when creating dishes."Understanding ratios and proportions when creating dishes instead of recipes makes students think and 【actually】 teaches them how to cook, rather than just reading a recipe and not learning from it," Garmy said. Garmy said he believes in using all aspects of a product, which Taylor's 【menu】 reflects.

195.Linda Finch. 琳达·芬奇  

Over sixty years after Amelia Earhart vanished mysteriously in the Pacific during her attempt to become the first person to circumnavigate the world along the equator, Linda Finch, a San Antonio businesswoman, accomplished pilot, and aviation historian, recreated and completed her idol's last flight as a 【tribute】 to the aviation pioneer's spirit and vision. On March 17, 1997, Ms. Finch and a navigator took off from Oakland International Airport, California, in a restored Lockheed Electra 10 E, the same make and model 【aircraft】 that Earhart used on her last journey. The mission to fulfil Amelia Earhart's dream was called"World Flight 1997". Although Ms. Finch was not the first to 【attempt】 Earhart's around- the world journey, she was the first to do it in a historic aeroplane. Linda Finch closely followed the same route that Earhart flew, stopping in 18 countries before finishing the trip two and a half months later when she 【landed】 back at the Oakland Airport on May 28. Over a million school children and others were able to follow the flight 【daily】 through an 【interactive】 web site part of a free multimedia educational programme called"You Can Soar", provided by the project's sponsor.

196.Dictatorship. 独裁统治  

Dictatorship is not a modern concept. Two thousand years ago, during the period of the Roman Republic, exceptional powers were sometimes given by the Senate to 【individual】 dictators such as Sulla and Julius Caesar. The 【intention】 was that the dictatorship would be temporary and that it would make it 【possible】 to take swift and effective action to deal with an emergency. There is some 【disagreement】 as how the term should be applied today. Should it be used in its original form to describe the temporary exercise of emergency powers? Or can it now be 【applied】 in a much broader sense as common usage suggests?

197.Austria. 奥地利  

Since Austria sits at a high elevation and spends a quarter of the year under 【snow】, it should come as no surprise that heating is a matter of considerable 【importance】 in the 【country】. What may be surprising, however, is that Vienna, a grand imperial city of music, art, and history, actually boasts a museum 【dedicated】 specifically to heating systems.

198.Emerald green. 翡翠绿  

Emerald is defined by its green colour. To be an emerald, a specimen must have a 【distinctly】 green colour that falls in the range from bluish green to green to slightly yellowish green. To be an emerald, the specimen must also have a rich colour. Stones with weak saturation or light tone should be called"green beryl." If the beryl's colour is greenish blue then it is an"aquamarine." 【If】 it is greenish yellow it is"heliodor." This colour definition is a source of confusion. Which hue, tone, and saturation combinations are the dividing lines between"green beryl" and"emerald"? Professionals in the gem and jewellery trade can disagree on where the lines should be 【drawn】. Some believe that the name"emerald" should be used when chromium is the cause of the green colour, and that stones coloured by vanadium should be called"green beryl." Calling a gem an"emerald" instead of a"green beryl" can have a significant 【impact】 upon its price and marketability. This"【color confusion】" exists within the United States. In some other countries, any beryl with a green colour, no matter how faint, is called an"emerald."

199.Zika. 寨卡病毒  

Zika is more pernicious than public health officials anticipated. At present, it is circulating in more than 50 countries. And as of mid-May, seven countries or territories have reported cases of microcephaly or other serious birth defects linked to the virus, which 【is transmitted】 by mosquito bite, blood transfusion or sexual contact with an infected human. It can also be passed from mother to foetus during pregnancy.
Despite Zika's vast 【range】 over almost 70 years, there is little genetic difference among the various strains, according to an analysis by researchers at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. For example, the strain currently in the Americas and another previously detected in French Polynesia are practically 【indistinguishable】 from each other, group in white box. If the virus has changed so little over time, why is it rearing its ugly head now? Scientists are not sure yet, but new experimental work in mosquitoes suggests that the virus was capable of 【causing】 detrimental health effects and outbreaks all along. Therefore, it is unlikely mutations enabled new abilities. Instead, public health officials probably did not understand Zika's potential because the virus 【circulated】 mostly in remote locations until recently.

200.The Ironbridge Gorge. 铁桥峡谷  

The Ironbridge Gorge World Heritage property covers an area of 5.5 km2, 550 ha, and is located in Telford, Shropshire, approximately 50 km north-west of Birmingham. The Industrial Revolution had its 18th-century 【roots】 in the Ironbridge Gorge before spreading across the world, bringing with it some of the most far-reaching changes in human history. The site incorporates a 5 km length of the steep-sided, mineral-rich Severn Valley from a point immediately west of Ironbridge downstream to Coalport, together with two smaller river valleys extending northwards to Coalbrookdale and Madeley. The Ironbridge Gorge offers a powerful 【insight】 into the origins of the Industrial Revolution and also contains 【extensive】 evidence and remains of that period when the area was the focus of international attention from artists, engineers, and writers. The site contains substantial remains of mines, foundries, factories, workshops, warehouses, ironmasters' and workers' housing, public buildings, infrastructure, and transport systems, together with traditional 【landscape】 and forests of the Severn Gorge. In addition, there also remain extensive 【collections】 of artefacts and archives relating to the individuals, processes and products that made the area so important. Today, the site is a living, working community with a population of approximately 4000 people. It is also a 【historic】 landscape that is interpreted and made accessible through the work of a number of organisations, in particular, the Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust established in 1967 to preserve and interpret the remains of the Industrial Revolution within the Ironbridge Gorge and the Severn Gorge Countryside Trust established in 1991 to manage the woodland and grassland in the Gorge.

201.Divorces in Australia. 澳大利亚离婚率  

In 2005, 109,000 new marriages were registered in Australia. This was equivalent to 5.4 marriages for every 1,000 people in the population. This rate has been in overall decline since 1986 when there were 7.2 marriages per 1,000 people.
Over the same period, the crude divorce rate has remained relatively unchanged with 2.6 divorces for every 1, 000 people in 2005 and 2.5 divorces per 1,000 people in 1986. The greatest annual number of divorces occurred in 2001 when there were 55,300 divorces recorded. This peak has been followed by recent declines, with 52,400 divorces in 2005.
As well as marrying less, Australians are 【tending】 to marry later than in the past. In 1986, the median age at first marriage for men was 25.6 years, increasing to 30.0 years in 2005. For women, the median age at first marriage increased from 23.5 years in 1986 to 28.0 years in 2005.
People are also divorcing at older ages. In 2005, the median age of divorcing men was 43.5 years, compared with 37.5 years in 1986, while for women the median age in 2005 was 40.8 compared with 34.7 years in 1986.
The 【decline】 in marriage rates and increase in divorce rates has led to a 【decrease】 in the 【level】 of the population that is formally married. In 1986, 60 percent of the population aged 15 years and over were married; by 2001 this proportion had decreased to 55 percent. 【Conversely】, the proportion of the population aged 15 years and over who were never married increased from 29 percent in 1986 to 32 percent in 2001.

202.Science. 科学

203.Population change. 人口变化  

Populations can change through three processes: fertility, mortality and migration. Fertility 【involves】 the number of children that women 【have】 and differs from fecundity, a woman's childbearing potential. Mortality involves the causes, consequences and measurement of processes affecting death in a population. Demographers most commonly study mortality using the Life Table, a statistical 【device】 which provides information about the mortality conditions most notably the life expectancy in the population. Migration refers to the movement of persons from an origin place to a destination place across some pre-defined political boundary. Migration researchers do not designate movements as migrations, 【unless】 they are somewhat permanent. Thus demographers do not consider tourists and traveller to be migrating. While demographers who study migration typically do so through census data on place of 【residence】, indirect sources of data including tax forms and labour force surveys.
Demography is today widely taught in many universities across the world, 【attracting】 students with initial training in social sciences, statistics or health studies.

204.Small. 小的

206.Bones. 骨骼  

Bones are extremely strong. One of their 【main】 functions is to protect organs. For example, the skull protects the brain and forms the shape of the face. The spinal cord, a pathway for messages between the brain and the body, is protected by the backbone, or spinal column. The ribs form a cage that shelters 【the】 heart and lungs, and the pelvis helps protect the bladder, part of the intestines, and in women, the reproductive organs. Joints make the skeleton flexible, without them, movement 【would】 be impossible. 【Three】 kinds of freely movable joints play a big part in voluntary movement: Hinge joints allow movement in one direction, as 【seen】 in the knees and elbows. Pivot joints allow a rotating or twisting motion, like that of the head moving from side to side. Ball-and-socket joints allow the greatest freedom of movement. The hips and shoulders have this type of joint, in which the round end of a long bone fits into the hollow of another bone.

207.Sydney density. 悉尼人口密度  

Sydney is becoming effective in making the best of its limited available unconstrained land. Sydney is suitable for integrating suitable business, office, residential, retail and other 【development】 in accessible locations so as to maximise public transport 【patronage】 and encourage walking and cycling. Also this city can reduce the 【consumption】 of land for housing and associated urban development on the urban fringe. For the proposed mixed business, mixed-use and business park areas, there was no employment data available for 【comparable】 areas. It is also concluded that lack of housing supply will affect 【affordability】 in Sydney.

208.Charles Dickens. 查尔斯·狄更斯  

At the age of 12, the delicate and genteelly brought up Charles Dickens was 【plunged】 into employment in a boot-blacking factory, while his father was incarcerated in Marshalsea debtors' prison. These events traumatised the young Dickens, and greatly 【influenced】 his future work. However, as an adult this difficult period was never discussed, and only after his death did his account come out. That account has never been corroborated or challenged, but author Michael Allen has 【discovered】 that Dickens' employers at Warren's Blacking were fighting each other in the Chancery Court, revealing a great deal of new information.

209.Nightjar. 夜鹰  

The nightjar's soft plumage and variegated colouring help it 【blend】 in with its surrounds, 【but】 it is the bird's own judgement in choosing the most sympathetic background that 【makes】 it a camouflage champion. Each bird chooses where to nest 【based】 on its specific patterns and colours, says camouflage researcher Martin Stevens, of the Center for Ecology and Conservation at the University of Exeter in Cornwall."Each individual bird looks a little bit different," he says."This is not a species level choice. Individual birds consistently sit in places that enhance their own unique markings, 【both】 within a habitat and at a fine scale with regards to specific background sites."

210.Computer simulation. 计算机模拟  

The purpose of this paper is to consider the claim, often made, that computer simulation exercises provide an excellent source of speaking practise. In so doing I shall first consider the properties of computer simulations from a theoretical 【point of view】, then describe the experience of 【using】 a particular simulation with a general EFL class. On the basis of this experience, and of some very straightforward pedagogical considerations, I shall argue that the claim is justified, 【subject to】 a very important caveat: computer simulations can form the basis of excellent speaking exercises, provided you do not expect the computer to do all the work. Put in another way, many computer simulations only 【attain】 their full potential as language exercises if they are 【integrated】 into a larger, planned, teacher- managed activity.

211.Heart of Study. 研究核心  

Turning now to the heart of the study, in two divisions an attempt 【was made】 to change the supervision so that the decision levels were 【pushed down】 and detailed supervision of the workers reduced. More general supervision of the clerks and their supervisors was introduced. In addition, the managers, assistant managers, supervisors and assistant supervisors of these two divisions were 【trained】 in group methods of leadership, which they 【endeavoured】 to use as much as their skill would permit during the experimental year. For easy reference, the experimental changes in these two divisions 【will be labeled】 the' participative programme'!

212.A bad title. 糟糕的标题  

A good story may be given a bad title by its author, and so started toward failure. Novices are peculiarly 【liable】 to this fault, usually through 【allowing】 themselves to be too easily satisfied. They go to 【infinite】 pains to make the story itself fresh and individual, and then cap it with a 【commonplace】 phrase that is worse than no title at all. A good title is apt, specific, attractive, new, and short. A title is apt if it is an outgrowth of the plot, a text, as I have said. It stands definitely for that particular story, and gives a suggestion of what is to come, but only a suggestion, lest it should anticipate the denouement and so 【satisfy】 the curiosity of the reader too soon.

213.Genetically Modified Foods. 转基因食品  

Genetically modified foods provide no 【direct】 benefit to consumers; the food is not 【noticeably】 better or cheaper. The greater benefit, 【proponents】 argue, is that genetic engineering will play a crucial role in 【feeding】 the world's 【burgeoning】 population. Opponents disagree, 【asserting】 that the world already grows more food per person than ever before- more, even, than we can 【consume】.

214.Fitness club. 健身俱乐部  

Whether you want to exercise and stay 【healthy】, train professionally with like-minded people, or indulge your competitive streak, Trinity Sport and Fitness 【has it covered】. We've got a dedicated support development team on campus to support every student in 【taking】 part in sports. You might want to participate in sports competitions volunteer with a local sports class or simply play for 【fun】 with our social sport programme. Trinity fitness members of our public-facing sports facility will also 【entitle】 you to discounts when you are booking a sports facility and fitness class. You will also 【get】 an opportunity to 【benefit】 from tailored personal training, free activities events, and lots more.

215.Chemicals. 化学品  

Chemicals used to control weeds in crops such as corn and soybeans may sometimes run off farmland and enter surface water bodies such as lakes and streams. If a surface water body that is used as a 【drinking】 water supply receives excess amounts of these herbicides, then the municipal water treatment plant must 【filter】 them out in order for the water to be safe to drink. This added filtration process can be expensive. Farmers can help control excess herbicides in runoff by choosing chemicals that bind with 【soil】 more readily, are less toxic, or degrade more quickly. Additionally, selecting the best tillage practise can help minimise herbicide 【pollution】.

216.Lumiere. 卢米埃尔（兄弟）  

Our sense of cinema as a site of commercial entertainment can be traced back to the Lumiere brothers. In December 1895 they 【attracted】 a fee-paying public in Paris to sit and watch flickering images on an illuminated screen. The commercial Pandora's Box they opened was to blossom in a few years into a world cinema 【industry】 and, at its peak, the fantastical Hollywood. Yet in the 30 years in which this miraculous construction was accomplished, audiences rarely 【had】 to 【listen】 to films, only watch them. Hence, the early decades of cinema were characterised by the title silent. 【In fact】, there was a lot of noise, machinery, audiences, musicians and commentators. Even so, the absence of the human voice and 【dialogue】 make the films seem rather strange when viewed by a modern audience.

217.Pop stars. 流行明星  

A MUSIC student at the University of Salford who wrote a song in two weeks is celebrating 【after】 being featured on a compilation album produced by Metropolis Studios. Pop mega-stars including Adele, Michael Jackson and Sir Elton John have all recorded music at the world-famous Metropolis Studios. Last year, the recording studios set 【about】 compiling an album called' Lost Songs', which features songs from relatively unknown musicians. First-year student Zak Taylor Fray decided to submit his song demo to be included in Volume Two of the Lost Songs album which was released this year, after he saw 【how】 successful Volume One had been. Zak 24, said:"I found this competition when simply 【searching】 the internet for songwriting competitions one day, and was lucky that there was still 【time】 to enter. It amazes me that people who have worked with huge pop stars thought my song was good and worth something."

218.Believe it or not. 信不信由你

219.Mass-communication. 大众传播  

Traditionally, mass-communications research has conceptualised the process of communication in terms of a circulation circuit or loop. This 【model】 has been criticised for its linearity, sender, message, receiver- for its concentration on the level of message exchange and for the absence of a structured conception of the different moments as a complex structure of relations. But it is also 【useful】 to think of this process in terms of a structure produced and sustained through the articulation of linked 【but】 distinctive moments production, circulation, distribution, consumption, reproduction. This would be to think of the 【process】 as a' complex structure in dominance', sustained through the articulation of connected practises, each of which, however, retains its distinctiveness and has its own 【specific】 modality, its own forms and conditions of existence.

220.Supreme Court. 最高法院  

One of the Supreme Court's most important 【responsibilities】 is to decide cases that raise questions of constitutional interpretation. The Court decides if a law or government 【action】 violates the Constitution. This is known as judicial review and enables the Court to invalidate both federal and state laws when they 【conflict】 with the Constitution. Since the Supreme Court stands as the ultimate authority in constitutional interpretation, its decisions can be 【changed】 only by another Supreme Court decision or by a constitutional amendment.

221.Emotions. 情绪

222.Bennett. 贝内特  

In the last years of the wheat boom, Bennett had become increasingly 【frustrated】 at how the government seemed to be encouraging an 【exploitative】 farming binge. He went directly after the Department of Agriculture for 【misleading】 people. Farmers on the Great Plains were working 【against】 nature, he 【thundered】 in speeches.

223.David Lynch. 大卫·林奇  

David Lynch is professor and head of education at Charles Darwin University. 【Prior】 to this he was sub dean in the Faculty of Education and Creative Arts at Central Queensland University and foundation head of the University's Noosa 【campus】. David's career in education began as a primary school teacher in Queensland in the early 1980' s and 【progressed】 to four principal positions before 【entering】 higher education. David's research interests predominate in teacher education with particular interest in building teacher capability to meet a changed world.

224.Darkness. 黑暗  

The increasing darkness in the Northern Hemisphere this time of year indicates to the plant that 【fall】 is coming on. So it starts recouping materials from the 【leaves】 before they drop off. Evergreens protect their needle- like foliage from freezing with 【waxy】 coatings and natural"antifreezes." But broadleaf plants, like sugar maples, birches, and sumacs, have no such protections. As a result, they 【shed】 their leaves. But before they do, the plants first try to 【salvage】 important nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus.

225.Standard language. 标准语言  

At the beginning of the twenty-first century, the relationship between standard and nonstandard language is, evidently, still an uncertain one. We are at a 【transitional】 point between two eras. We seem to be leaving an era when the rules of Standard English, as elected and defined by prescriptive grammarians, totally conditioned our sense of 【acceptable】 usage, so that all other usages and varieties were considered to be inferior or corrupt, and 【excluded】 from serious consideration. And we seem to be 【approaching】 an era when nonstandard usages and varieties, previously denigrated or ignored, are achieving a new presence and 【respectability】 within society, reminiscent of that found in Middle English, when dialect variation in literature was widespread and uncontentious. But we are not there 【yet】. The rise of Standard English has resulted in a confrontation between the standard and nonstandard dimensions of the language which has lasted for over 200 years, and this has had traumatic 【consequences】 which will take some years to eliminate. Once people have been given an inferiority complex about the way they speak or write, they find it difficult to shake off.

226.Archaeology. 考古学  

Archaeology is the study of our human past. The evidence that archaeologists use to answer these questions is often found during excavations or digs. The evidence can 【include】 objects like pottery, jewellery, building materials, coins, weapons and tools. Soil samples from archaeological sites can reveal information about past environments, like what kinds of plants were 【growing】. Features like ditches, pits, post holes and the remains of walls can help archaeologists piece 【together】 what buildings looked like and what they were made of. The ways that people were buried tells us about past beliefs, and the skeletons themselves reveal information about people's health in the past and the types of diseases and injuries that killed them. Scientific 【experiments】 on teeth can even show where people came from.

227.Katakana. 片假名  

An eccentric mix of English, German and French has entered Japanese usage with grand abandon. A"kariya" woman is a career woman, and a"manshon" is an apartment. This increasing use of katakana, or unique Japanese versions of Western words, and the younger generation's more casual use of the Japanese language have 【prompted】 Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi to worry that these new words may not be understood by a wider audience. 【As a result】, a government panel is proposing to publish a manual on how to speak proper Japanese. Foreign words became katakana Japanese 【because】 no existing Japanese words could quite capture a specific meaning or feeling. When the word"cool" travelled east, all of its English connotations did not make the journey. A kuru person in Japan is someone who is calm and never gets upset. 【On the other hand】, someone who is kakkoii is hip, or in translation,"cool." 【Similarly】, a hotto person is one who is easily excitable, perhaps passionate, but not necessarily a popular person or personality of the moment.

228.French lords. 法国领主  

France was still essentially a feudal nation with lords, due to a range of ancient and modern rights from their peasants who comprised about 80 percent of the population and the majority lived in rural contexts. France was a predominantly agricultural nation, 【even though】 this agriculture was low in productivity, wasteful, and using out of date methods. An attempt to introduce modern techniques from Britain had not succeeded. Inheritance laws, 【whereby】 estates were divided up among all the heirs, had 【left】 France divided into many tiny farms; even the large estates were small when compared to other European nations. The only major region 【of】 large-scale farming was around Paris, where the always hungry capital city provided a convenient market. Harvests were critical but fluctuating, causing famine, high prices, and riots.

229.TV. 音乐电视

230.Fluid Mechanics. 流体力学  

Fluid Mechanics with Historical Perspective is part of a series of modules covering the broader subject of thermodynamics at the University of Bath. At the start of each hour-long lecture, the tutor gives a 15-minute input on the aspect of discoveries and developments related to flight. This historical background usually consists of a five-minute PowerPoint presentation, 【followed】 by a short video clip proving the context for the formulate and calculations that are to be explained in the lecture. For example, at the start of a lecture on compressible flow of gases, the presentation is on the story of the first supersonic flight. The tutor 【developed】 24' mini-history lectures' to accompany the lecture series which he hopes will make this largely theoretical-based subject more interesting for his students. The lectures are supported by a set of notes 【given】 out at the beginning of each topic. The notes include visual images, as well as a brief note on the historical 【perspective】 shown and the theoretical concepts explored. The notes are not, however, complete and students are expected to bring them to the lecture each week to fill in the blanks.

233.Good information. 优质信息  

Good information One of the characteristics of' good' information identified earlier was that it should be' balanced'. In an ideal world,' objective' or' balanced' information would present all the 【evidence】 for and against, and leave you to weigh this up and draw conclusions. In the real world, however, we recognise that all information presents a position of 【interest】, although this may not necessarily be intentional. Objectivity may therefore be an unachievable ideal. This means that the onus is on you as the reader and user of the information to 【develop】 a critical awareness of the positions represented in what you read, and to take account of this when you interpret the information. In some cases, authors may explicitly express a particular viewpoint, this is perfectly valid as long as they are open about the perspective they represent. Hidden bias, whether or not it is 【deliberate】, can be misleading. This could be particularly important in a subject area where there is controversy.

234.Customer Demand. 客户需求  

It originally referred to the production of goods to meet customer 【demand】 exactly in time, quality and quantity, 【whether】 the' customer' is the final purchaser of the product or another process 【further】 along the production line.

235.A giant turtle. 巨型龟  

A giant turtle made from discarded plastic trash will greet visitors to the British Science Festival this week. The plastic containers, bottles and cups were collected locally in Hull, where the event is taking place at the city's university. Standing 3.5 m tall, 11.5ft, the art installation 【was】 commissioned by the University of Hull with the aim of raising 【awareness】 of plastic waste. Professor Dan Parsons, director of the university's Energy and Environment Institute, said:"Marine pollution is a mounting global challenge, which is 【already】 having devastating consequences." We have a duty to protect these fragile environments and the marine life and ecosystems which we 【call】 home. The university has commissioned this installation as a physical 【reminder】 of what is ending up in the oceans, but also ask visitors to campus to stop and think what they could do to try to reduce their own waste."

236.Crime. 犯罪  

A crime is generally a deliberate act that results in harm, physical or otherwise, toward one or more people, in a manner 【prohibited】 by law. The determination of which acts are to be considered criminal has varied 【historically】, and continues to do so among cultures and nations. When a crime is committed, a process of 【discovery】, trial by judge or jury, conviction, and punishment occurs. Just as what is considered criminal varies between 【jurisdictions】, so does the punishment, but elements of restitution and 【deterrence】 are common.

237.Societal expectation. 社会期望  

Social expectations are not static and tend to rise over time, particularly in a wealthy nation like the UK. For example, the standards of safety 【accepted】 in a motor car 50 years ago would be considered to be 【totally】 inadequate at the beginning of the 21 st century. People expect safe, quiet, comfortable cars that do not break down and which retain their appearance for many thousands of miles. Industry should strive to deliver these same high standards for the wealth and safety of employees or service 【providers】. The question is whether societal expectations are as great an influence on workplace safety standards as they are on product safety standards.

238.Poetry and confidence. 诗歌与自信

239.Non-indigenous Plants. 非本土植物  

The invasion of non- indigenous plants is considered a primary threat to integrity and function of ecosystems. However, there is little quantitative or 【experimental】 evidence for ecosystem impacts of invasive species. Justifications for control are often based on potential, but not presently realised, recognised or quantified, negative impacts. Should lack of scientific certainty about impacts of non- indigenous species result in postponing measures to prevent degradation? Recently, management of purple loosestrife- Lythrum salicaria , has been criticised for lack of evidence demonstrating negative impacts of L. salicaria, and management using biocontrol for lack of evidence documenting the failure of conventional control methods. Although little quantitative evidence on negative impacts on native wetland biota and wetland function was available at the onset of the control programme in 1985, recent work has demonstrated that the invasion of purple loosestrife into North American freshwater wetlands alters 【decomposition】 rates and nutrient cycling, leads to reductions in wetland plant diversity, reduces pollination and seed output of the native Lythrum alatum, and reduces habitat 【suitability】 for specialised wetland bird species such as black terns, least bitterns, pied- billed grebes, and marsh wrens. Conventional methods- physical, mechanical or chemical , have continuously failed to 【curb】 the spread of purple loosestrife or to provide satisfactory control. Although a number of generalist insect and bird species utilise purple loosestrife, wetland habitat specialists are excluded by 【encroachment】 of L. salicaria. We conclude that negative ecosystem impacts of purple loosestrife in North America justify control of the species and that 【detrimental】 effects of purple loosestrife on wetland systems and biota and the potential benefits of control outweigh potential risks associated with the introduction of biocontrol agents. Long term experiments and monitoring programmes that are in place will evaluate the impact of these insects on purple loosestrife, on wetland plant succession and other wetland biota.

240.People live longer. 人类寿命延长  

People are generally living longer than previous generations across most parts of the world. Rising life expectancy is a result of advances in medicine as well as improving living standards and healthier lifestyles. But while this should be 【celebrated】 for social reasons, is it beneficial in economic terms? Does the increase in the older population create an 【economic】 burden on society or can older people be mobilised 【to enhance】 the productivity of communities in which they work and live?
New analysis of international data from 35 countries, published by the International Longevity Center, provides more evidence 【in favor of】 a"longevity dividend". The authors found that as life expectancy increases, so 【does】"output per hour worked, per worker and per capita"

241.Substitute. 替代品  

While workers worry about whether robots will take their jobs, teachers are wondering how to use education to insulate the next generation from such a fate. This 【has worked】 before. When the last wave of automation swept the developed world at the start of the 20th century, policymakers decided education was the answer. If machines were going to substitute for brawn, they 【reasoned】, more people would need to use their brains. The US invested 【heavily】 in education, with good results. Workers reaped the benefits through better jobs and higher wages. Economists Andrew McAfee and Erik Brynjolfsson summed it up like this:"The Industrial Revolution 【started】 a race 【between】 technology and education, and, for most of the 20th century, humans won that race."

242.Democratic government. 民主政府  

The essential problem, as Rosenfeld sees it, is that democratic government is predicated on an aspiration to collective truth. 【Unlike】 older systems of aristocratic and monarchical rule, which excluded the people from power and stressed the need for administrative secrecy, the new republics of the late 18 th century, and the more egalitarian mass democracies that 【succeeded】 them, depended on openness and trust between citizens and rulers. Through the free discussion and united wisdom of the educated and the masses, errors would be dispelled,"public knowledge" established and societies advanced. And yet, she points out, the reality has never 【lived up to】 this powerful ideal. From the 【outset】, democratic societies contained vast inequalities of power and education, and their media have always been driven by commercial and partisan imperatives. In 【practise】, instead of a free civil marketplace of ideas, politics has always been a vicious fight over the truth and the power of determining it.

243.Renewable energy. 可再生能源  

Recently, due to concerns over pollution and the possibility that some sources of fuel might eventually run out or become 【uneconomic】 to obtain, there has been much greater support for renewable sources of power, such as wind or solar energy. Renewable energy sources 【provide】 25 percent of the electricity we use. Unlike 【fossil】 fuels, they tend not to produce any waste or significantly add to global warming by producing gases.

244.Underground houses. 地下房屋  

Underground houses have many advantages over conventional housing. Unlike conventional homes, they can be built on 【steep】 surfaces and can maximise space in small areas by going below the surface. In addition, the materials excavated in construction can be used in the building process. Underground houses have less surface area so fewer building materials are used, and 【maintenance】 costs are lower. They are also wind, fire, and earthquake resistant, providing a secure and safe environment in extreme weather.
One of the greatest benefits of underground living is energy 【efficiency】. The earth's subsurface temperature remains stable, so underground dwellings benefit from geothermal mass and heat exchange, staying cool in the summer and warm in the winter. This saves around 80 percent in energy costs. By 【incorporating】 solar design this energy bill can be 【reduced】 to zero, providing hot water and heat to the home all year round.

245.Lucy. 露西（古人类化石）  

Lucy was a single hominid skeleton found in Ethiopia. First, she was a bunch of broken fragments lying in Ethiopia. She was found by Donald Johanson and Tom Gray, who headed out to the area looking for rocks, and then drove back. 【During】 that return journey, Johanson spotted a forearm bone, identified it, and then kept looking, where the two found a huge set of bones that would eventually 【represent】 40 percent of the entire skeleton. The discovery was so important because it entirely 【upset】 our understanding of the process of evolution. She showed that people had been wrong to think that we became intelligent before we stood up, Lucy and her contemporaries were better suited for walking 【upright】 than we were, but appear to have been much less 【intellectually】 advanced. That was important because it changed our understanding of the story of evolution, implying that walking was one of the most important things in moving us towards our current state, and that brainpower might not have been the most important thing.

246.iPhone. 苹果手机  

The iPhone is a line of touchscreen- based smartphones designed and marketed by Apple Inc. that use Apple's iOS mobile operating system. The first- generation iPhone was 【announced】 by Apple co-founder Steve Jobs on January 9, 2007. Since then Apple has periodically released new iPhone models and iOS updates. of November 1, 2018, more than 2. 2 billion iPhones had been sold. The iPhone's user interface is built around a multi-touch screen with a 【virtual】 keyboard. The iPhone connects to cellular networks or Wi-Fi. An iPhone can make calls, browse the web, take pictures, play music and send and receive emails and text messages. Since the iPhone's launch further features have been added, including larger screen sizes, shooting video, waterproofing and the ability to instal third- party mobile apps through an app store, 【as well as】 accessibility support. Up to 2017, iPhones used a layout with a single button on the front panel that returns the user to the home screen. Since 2017, more expensive iPhone models have switched to a nearly bezel- less front screen design with app switching activated by gesture 【recognition】.

247.Musical experience. 音乐体验  

The general perception is that children are surrounded by a variety of musical experiences. There are often fewer and fewer opportunities for children to actively engage in music making themselves. They are inundated with music emitting from a wide 【array】 of electronic devices, toys, and computers offering a limitless number of musical selections. However, much of the music in children's lives is"unchosen," in other words they are 【passive】 recipients in much of the music in their lives, and not actively engaged in its selection. They experience background music in computer games, cartoons, TV shows, films, on iPads, radios, and ringtones. They listen to music choices of their parents or siblings, and even the schools they attend often play music before the school day begins or in classrooms 【while】 students are working. Studies are being 【conducted】 on the effects of the ubiquitous pre-recorded music they encounter and whether or not it is 【intruding】 on their desire to make their own music or interact with each other on the playground.

248.Advanced animals. 高级动物

250.Mechanical engineering. 机械工程  

Mechanical engineering was at the heart of Taylor's theorising, providing the context for its development, the world view by which it was sustained and, finally, the justification for its widespread application. Scientific management aimed 【to analyze】 and control the activities of people 【in the same way that】, engineers analysed and controlled machines. Central 【to】 Taylor's system was the desire to rationalise and standardise production techniques in the interests of economy, efficiency and mutual prosperity. His primary point of interest was the individual worker 【pursuing】 individual goals and motivated by incentive payments. 【Undoubtedly】 Taylor's view of human motivation was somewhat simplistic and his apprehension of the significance of groups limited and generally negative.

251.Educational scheme. 教育计划  

The Elder Academy scheme, an education and social inclusion initiative, was 【launched】 in early 2007 by The Labor and Welfare Bureau and the Elderly Commission. The activities provide 【access】 to learning opportunities in schools and university campuses and are aimed primarily at older people who have had little or no education. The scheme optimises the use of existing 【educational】 facilities and has been successful in promoting both lifelong and initial learning for older people, encouraging participation and helping to maintain 【physical】 and mental wellbeing. School and university students are engaged in the scheme, thereby also promoting civic education and intergenerational understanding. Currently, some 125 elder academies in various districts and seven tertiary institutions offer a wide variety of courses.

252.Drama. 戏剧  

I do not think I am twisting the usual meaning of drama if I define it as a presentation before spectators by performers who take on roles and Juho interact with each other to further a story, or a text intended for such presentation. This is intended as a 【working】 definition, simple enough to be recalled easily to the mind. Indeed, it is so simple that I should 【point】 out that it makes one or two distinctions that are perhaps not immediately obvious. First, to say that performers"take on roles" leaves 【open】 the possibility that they are not within the roles throughout the performance, as such alternative phrases as"performers in character" or"characters represented by actors" do not. To say that the performers"interact with each other" might seem 【unnecessary】, but is in fact important, for in traditional societies there are many performances in which different characters appear successively or simultaneously but who 【nevertheless】 do not interact. And I say"to further a story" because the progression of the story may not provide the structure for the performance.

253.Mendeleev. 门捷列夫  

Uniquely stable, they 【seemed】 to participate in no chemical reactions. But by understanding the stability of the noble gases, physicists discovered the key to chemical bonding 【itself】. Dmitri Mendeleev added the noble gases to his periodic table in 1902, where he 【arranged】 the elements in rows and columns 【according】 to their atomic weight.
Mendeleev was able to see repeating, or periodic, patterns in their properties. The noble gases appeared 【regularly】 in the periodic table, occurring in every eighth position, at least amongst the lighter elements.

254.Foraminifera. 有孔虫  

Scientists have discovered the cause of a mass extinction of sea- floor marine organisms 800, 000 years ago- which also provides insight into how climate change can impact 【on】 deep ocean biota. In a new study 【published】 in the journal Nature Communications, scientists from the universities of Nottingham and Durham and the British Geological Survey, BGS , have discovered the cause of a mass extinction within marine organisms called foraminifera. Foraminifera are an important group in relation to biomass in the deep ocean and the cause of their extinction was 【previously】 unknown. Scientists tested various possible 【causes】 for the mass extinction and were able to discount others such as ocean cooling. 【Instead】, they discovered that the extinction was caused by a global change in plankton at the surface of the ocean.

255.Paraphrasing. 释义  

Paraphrasing is often defined as putting a passage from an author into your own words. However, what are your own words? How different must your paraphrase be from the original? The answer is it should be 【considerably】 different. The whole point of paraphrasing is to show you have read and understood another person's ideas, and can summarise them in your own writing style rather than borrowing their phrases. If you just change a few words, or add some bits 【of】 your own to an otherwise reproduced passage, you will probably be 【penalised】 for plagiarism. You should aim to 【condense】 and simplify a writer's ideas and describe them using different sentence structures and expressions. 【It is】 also important to credit the original writer by referencing.

256.Laptop. 笔记本电脑  

UMN's ALCs features large 【circular】 tables that seat nine students and can accommodate laptop computers for 【collaborative】 work. Typically, students bring their own computers to class and use the building's ubiquitous wireless capability. The classrooms are designed to 【facilitate】 hands-on activities and problems that require students to interact with each other to reach a solution. Students can display their work on large LCD screens mounted around the room to promote small-and large-group discussions. Each table is allotted three gooseneck microphones so that students can make themselves heard without shouting during group discussions. Additionally, students can press a button on their table console to light a 【signal】 lamp to 【indicate】 when they need help or wish to speak. To facilitate brainstorming and group reporting, the room is also lined with erasable marker-boards.

257.Sociology. 社会学  

Sociology is the study of human societies. It is usually 【classed】 as one of the social sciences and was 【established】 as a subject in the late 18th century.
【However】, the subject has only really gained 【acceptance】 as an academic subject in the 20th century through the work of writers such as Emile Durkheim, Max Weber and Talcott Parsons. One name that you may have heard of, Karl Marx, has probably done more to 【stimulate】 people's interest in the subject than anyone else, even though he lived and wrote in a period before Sociology became fully established as an academic discipline.

258.Student-run Restaurant. 学生经营的餐厅  

The rest of Taylor's restaurant is student- run. Students in quantity food production and service management 【classes】 make the articulate and detailed dishes."We teach students to understand where a product comes from and to respect that product," Garmy said. Sceptics might doubt the 【quality】 of a student- run restaurant, but one visit to Taylor's will immediately change their outlook. Dishes such as orecchiette and butternut squash, pappardelle with duck and bistro chicken will please any appetite while imparting the need to 【return】 for a second taste. Students are taught to use ratios and proportions rather than recipes when creating dishes."Understanding ratios and proportions when creating dishes instead of recipes makes students think and 【actually】 teaches them how to cook, rather than just reading a recipe and not learning from it," Garmy said. Garmy said he believes in using all aspects of a product, which Taylor's 【menu】 reflects.

259.Colonial Era. 殖民时代  

At the end of the colonial era, as many new nations gained independence, relative levels of economic development became an important criterion 【by which】 to distinguish between countries. The former colonial powers and 【wealthier】 parts of the world generally became known as advanced industrial, or developed, countries, 【while】 former colonies and poorer nations became known as less developed, or more positively, developing countries. Critics of the 【uneven】 distribution of wealth across the globe highlighted the role which wealth creation in some places had played in impoverishing poorer nations and, rather, described them as actively underdeveloped. The question as to 【whether】 economic change is developing or underdeveloping countries remains a vital issue, as the debate over sweatshops highlights.

260.British lantern. 英国灯笼

261.Birds. 鸟类  

For birdwatchers in southern New Mexico, September can be highly entertaining. Good numbers of many diverse 【species】 are on the move during this time, 【travelling】 southward from northern 【breeding】 grounds to places they will spend the winter, and there's always a 【chance】 that some rare or unusual bird will turn up.

262.Love of reading. 阅读的热爱  

Many parents want their children to grow up with a love of reading. However, recent research has 【shown】 that children nowadays spend far more of their time using their phones or computers than reading books. Of course, technology brings children many advantages, but books are as important 【as】 computers. For instance, when children read storybooks, they imagine the characters and practise their language skills, too. Many British schools run an event called World Book Day. This event 【aims】 to promote reading to pupils using various fun activities. Some pupils come to school in costumes inspired by their favourite book. Other schools organise World Book Day activities where pupils create music, art or plays about books. But it's also important for children to read at home, too. At the moment, 【very few】 parents spend time reading with their children regularly. 【Unfortunately】, this means that these children are missing an opportunity to develop the reading habit at an early age.

263.Behaviorists. 行为主义者  

Another way to looking at personality is the behaviourist approach. According to behaviourists, the inner 【facts】 of the consciousness are not important. Instead, they believed that our behaviours, and therefore our 【personalities】 are learned primarily through our experiences. The theories of behaviourism arose through 【experiments】 largely on animals in which behaviours were learned through carefully controlled 【stimuli】.

264.Bees and flowers. 蜜蜂与花朵  

Bees and flowers have evolved together for millions of years. It is a 【mutual】 relationship where the bee is provided with food, nectar or pollen, and the stationary plant gets to 【disperse】 its pollen, sperm cells, to other plants of the same 【species】. For the plant this is much more efficient than using wind to reach the goal. Consequently, over millions of years plants have developed flowers with increasingly specialised features to attract visiting bees who, in turn, would distribute pollen grains and optimise the plant's reproductive 【capabilities】. Simultaneously, bees underwent physiological, behavioural and structural adaptations to take advantage of the nutritional benefits 【offered】 by flowering plants. This is an example of a co-evolutionary relationship.

265.Help Other People. 帮助他人  

There are many different ways to help other people. Perhaps the most common of these involves giving others 【practical】 help. In our society, there are many individuals who spontaneously help others in this way. Additionally, there are others who belong to organisations which have been set up to provide help to specific groups, such as the elderly, the disabled, and those with serious physical or 【mental】 health problems. Most importantly, there are many 【occupations】, such as nursing, occupational therapy and social work, which involve professionals who are trained to provide or organise practical help for others. 【While】 helping other people in a practical way, many volunteer and professional helpers also make use of some counselling skills. These skills can be very useful in enabling people to feel better as described in this book and our book, Counselling Skills in Everyday Life. However, it needs to be 【recognised】 that just being able to make use of some counselling skills does not qualify a person as a counsellor.

266.An abstract. 摘要  

An abstract is an original work, not an excerpted passage. An abstract must be fully self-contained and 【make】 sense by itself, without further reference to outside sources or to the actual paper. It highlihts key content areas, your research purpose, the relevance of importance of your work, and the main outcomes. It is a well-developed single paragraph of approximately 250 words in length, which is indented and spaced. The function of the abstract is to outline briefly all parts of the paper. Although 【it is placed】 at the beginning of your paper, immediately following the title page, the abstract should be the last thing that you write, 【once】 you are sure of the conclusions you will reach.

267.Newspapers. 报纸  

Who won the World Cup 1994 football game? What happened at the United Nations? How did the critics like the new play? Just when an event takes place, newspapers are on the streets to 【give】 the details. Wherever anything happens in the world, reporters are on the spot to 【gather】 the news. Newspapers have one basic purpose to get the news as quickly as possible from its source, from those who make it to those who want to know it. Radio, telegraph, television, and other inventions brought competition for newspapers. So did the development of magazines and other means of communication. However, this competition merely spurred the newspapers on. They quickly made use of the newer and faster means of communication to improve the 【speed】 and thus the efficiency of their own operations. Today more newspapers are printed and read than ever before. Competition also led newspapers to branch out into so many other fields. Besides keeping readers 【informed】 of the latest news, today's newspapers educate and influence readers about politics and other important and serious matters. Newspapers influence readers' economic choices through advertising. Most newspapers depend on advertising for their very existence. Newspapers are sold at a price that fails to cover even a small fraction of the cost of production. The main source of income for most newspapers is commercial advertising. The success is selling advertising depends on a newspaper's value to advertisers. This is 【measured】 in terms of circulation. How many people read the newspaper? Circulation depends much on the work of the circulation department and on the services or entertainment offered in a newspaper's pages. But for the most part, circulation depends on a newspaper's value to readers as a source of information about the community, city, country, state, nation and world and even outer space.

268.Life science. 生命科学  

The Life Science Institute at the University of Michigan achieves 【excellence】 in biomedical research by bringing together the world's 【leading】 scientists from a variety of life science disciplines to 【accelerate】 breakthroughs and discoveries that will improve human health. With close to 400 scientific staff members, the LSI is exploiting the power of a 【collaborative】 and interdisciplinary 【approach】 to biomedical research in an open-laboratory 【facility】.

269.Women's opportunities. 女性机会

270.Democracy. 民主

Democracy is a system of government in which laws, policies, leadership, and major 【undertakings】 of a state or other polity are directly or indirectly decided by the' people', a group historically constituted by only a minority of the population, e. g., all free adult males in ancient Athens or all sufficiently propertied adult males in 19 th-century Britain, but generally understood 【since】 the mid-20 th century to include all, or nearly all, adult citizens. By and large, states with democratic governments prevent rule by autocrats, 【guarantee】 fundamental individual rights, allow 【for】 a relatively high level of political equality, and rarely make war on each other. As compared with nondemocratic states, they also better foster human development as 【measured】 by indicators such as health and education, provide more prosperity for their citizens, and ensure a 【broader】 range of personal freedoms.

271.Marshmallow Test. 棉花糖实验

Mischel is the creator of the marshmallow test, one of the most famous experiments in the history of psychology, which is often cited as evidence of the importance of self-control. In the original test, which was administered at the Bing Nursery School, at Stanford, in the nineteen-sixties, Mischel's team would present a child with a treat and tell her that she could either eat the one treat 【immediately】 or wait alone in the room for several minutes until the researcher returned, at which point she could have two treats. The promised treats were always visible and the child knew that all she had to do to stop the agonising 【wait】 was ring a bell to call the experimenter back, although in that 【case】, she wouldn't get the second treat. The longer a child delayed gratification, Mischel found, that is, the longer she was able to wait, the better she would fare later in life at numerous measures of what we now call executive function. She would 【perform】 better academically, earn more money, and be healthier and happier. She would also be more likely to avoid a number of 【negative】 outcomes, including jail time, obesity, and drug use.

412.Charles Darwin. 查尔斯·达尔文

Charles Darwin knew intuitively that tropical forests were places of 【tremendous】 intricacy and energy. He and his cohort of scientific naturalists were 【awed】 by the beauty of the Neotropics, where they collected tens of thousands of 【species】 new to science. But they couldn't have guessed at the complete contents of the rainforest, and they had no idea of its 【value】 to humankind.

413.Women in Labour Force. 劳动力中的女性

With the increase in women's 【participation】 in the labour force, many mothers have less time 【available】 to undertake domestic activities. At the same time, there has been increasing 【recognition】 that the father's role and 【relationship】 with a child is important. A father can have many roles in the family, ranging from income provider to teacher, carer, playmate and role model. Therefore, balancing paid work and family responsibilities can be an important issue for both fathers and mothers in families.

414.Social Reforms. 社会改革

Social reforms are normally 【initiated】 as a result of statistical analyses of factors such as crime rates and poverty levels etc. Large- scale population can result from projections devised by statisticians. Manufacturers can provide better products at lower costs by 【using】 statistical control tools, 【such】 as control charts. Diseases are controlled through analyses designed to anticipate epidemics. Endangered species of fish and other wildlife are protected through regulations and laws that react to statistical estimates of changing population sizes. 【Through】 statistical analysis of fatality rates, legislators can better justify laws, such as those governing air pollution, auto inspections, seat belt and airbag use, and drunk driving.

415.MBA Programs. MBA项目

Deciding to go to business school is perhaps the simplest part of what can be a complicated process. With nearly 600 accredited MBA programmes on 【offer】 around the world, the choice of where to study can be overwhelming. Here we explain how to 【choose】 the right school and course for you and unravel the application and funding process."Probably the 【majority】 of people applying to business school are at a point in their careers where they know they 【want】 to shake things up, but they don't know exactly what they would like to do with their professional lives," says Stacy Blackman, an MBA admissions consultant based in Los Angeles."If that's the case with you, look at other 【criteria】: culture, teaching method, location, and then pick a place that's a good fit for you with a strong general management programme. Super- defined career goals don't have to be a part of this process."

416.Environmental Policy. 环境政策

Thus the environmental policy does not contribute to the profitability in any real sense at all. In practise it is companies that are well organised and efficient, or that are already comfortably profitable, that have time to 【establish】 and police environmental policies. However, if profitable companies are the ones most likely to establish' environmental best 【practise】' this is confusing cause with effect. It is not that environmental best practise causes profitability, but that being profitable allows for 【concern】 for the environment.

417.Rudman. 拉德曼

Rudman looks at how a poor understanding of Maths has led historians to false conclusions about the Mathematical sophistication of early societies. Rudman's final observation- that ancient Greece 【enjoyed】 unrivalled progress in the subject while 【failing】 to teach it at school- leads to a 【radical】 punchline: Mathematics could be better learnt after we 【leave】 school.

418.Crime Prevention. 犯罪预防

Crime prevention has a long history in Australia, and in other parts of the world. In all societies, people have tried to 【protect】 themselves and those close to them from assaults and other abuses. Every time someone locks the door to their house or their car, they practise 【a form of】 prevention. Most parents want their children to learn to be law abiding and not spend extended periods of their lives in prison. In this country, at least, most 【succeed】. Only a small minority of young people become recidivist offenders. In a functioning society, crime prevention is part of everyday life. While prevention can be all- pervasive at the grassroots, 【it】 is oddly neglected in mass media and political discourses. When politicians, talkback radio hosts and newspaper editorialists pontificate about crime and 【possible】 remedies, it is comparatively rare for them to mention prevention. Overwhelmingly, emphasis is on policing, sentencing and other' law and order' responses.

419.DNA Sequence. DNA序列

The recipe for making any creature is written in its DNA. So last November when geneticists published the near- complete DNA sequence of the long- extinct woolly mammoth, there was much 【speculation】 about whether we could bring this behemoth back to life. Creating a living, breathing creature from a genome sequence that exists only in a computer's memory is not possible right now. But someone someday is sure to try it, 【predicts】 Stephan Schuster, a 【molecular】 biologist at Pennsylvania State University, University Park, and a 【driving】 force behind the mammoth genome project.

420.Financial Crisis. 金融危机

Since the beginning of the financial crisis, there have been two principal 【explanations】 for why so many banks made such disastrous decisions. The first is structural. Regulators did not regulate. Institutions failed to 【function】 as they should. Rules and guidelines were either inadequate or ignored. The second explanation is that Wall Street was 【incompetent】, that the traders and investors didn't know enough, that they made extravagant bets without 【understanding】 the consequences.

421.Cause of Unemployment. 失业原因

One cause of unemployment may be downswings in the trade cycle, i. e. periods of recession. Another explanation of wide- scale unemployment refers to 【structural】 employment. Structural unemployment arises from longer-term changes in the economy, affecting 【specific】 industries, regions and occupations. Structural unemployment often explains regional unemployment. Some regions of the UK such as Central Scotland, and the North- West have higher rates of unemployment because the 【traditional】 heavy industries which 【located】 there have gone into decline as they are 【replaced】 by cheaper imports from abroad. The new high- tech industries based on new technologies tend to be based in the South- East and along particular growth corridors.

422.Graphene. 石墨烯

Fascination with this material stems from its remarkable physical properties and the potential applications these properties offer for the future. 【Although】 scientists knew one atom thick, two- dimensional crystal graphene existed, no- one 【had worked】 out how to extract it from graphite. That was until it was isolated in 2004 by two researchers at The University of Manchester, Professor Andre Geim and Professor Kostya Novoselov. This is the story of how that stunning scientific feat came about and why Andre and Kostya won the Nobel Prize in Physics for their pioneering work. Andre and Kostya frequently held' Friday night experiments'- sessions where they would try out experimental science that wasn't 【necessarily】 linked to their day jobs.

423.Track Down Research. 追踪研究

Having tracked down research that is 【relevant】 to your area of interest, the next task is to actually 【make sense】 of that research. This section is intended to show you how to be critical of the research you 【are reviewing】 and how to check that the 【evidence】 is credible and represented appropriately. Unfortunately this means discussing the ways in which research findings may be misrepresented.

424.Dag Hammarskjold Library. 达格·哈马舍尔德图书馆

The Dag Hammarskjold Library at United Nations Headquarters in New York is a library designated to facilitate the work of the United Nations and 【focuses】 mainly on the needs of the UN Secretariat and diplomatic missions. Anyone with a valid United Nations Headquarters grounds 【pass】, including specialised agencies, accredited media and NGO staff, is able to visit the library. Due to 【security】 constraints in place at the United Nations Headquarters complex, the library is not open to the general 【public】.

425.Pidgins. 皮钦语

Pidgins are languages that are born after contact between at least two languages. As many pidgins developed during the period of empire and international trade, one of the language parents was frequently a European language such as French or English, and the other language parent was the language of the people with whom the Europeans were 【trading】 or whom they were colonising. Usually one of the languages provided the majority of 【vocabulary】 items and the other provided the grammatical structure. When pidgins become learned as a mother tongue, they become 【known】 as creoles. I am not going to discuss pidgins and creoles and contact languages as such in this book in 【any depth】.

426.Coral Reefs. 珊瑚礁

Coral reefs 【support】 more marine life than any other ocean ecosystem and are, not 【surprisingly】, a favourite pursuit for many divers. But as well as being physically and biologically spectacular, coral reefs also sustain the livelihoods of over half a billion people. What is more, this number is expected to 【double】 in coming decades while the area of high- quality reef is expected to halve. In combination with the very real threat of climate change, which could lead to increased seawater temperatures and ocean acidification, we start to arrive at some quite frightening scenarios.

427.An Act. 一项法案

The Nature Conservation Amendment Act of 1996 enables the Minister of Environment and Tourism to register a conservancy if it has a 【representative】 committee, a legal constitution, which provides for the sustainable 【management】 and utilisation of game in the conservancy, the ability to 【manage】 the funds, an approved method for the 【equitable】 distribution of benefits to members of the community and defined boundaries.

428.Origin of Music. 音乐起源

Music is an important part of our lives. We connect and interact with it daily and use it as a way of projecting our self- identities to the people around us. The music we enjoy- whether it's country or classical, rock n' roll or rap- 【reflects】 who we are. But where did music, at its core, first come from? It's a puzzling question that may not have a definitive answer. One 【leading】 researcher, however, has proposed that the key to understanding the origin of music is nestled snugly in the loving bond between mother and child. In a lecture at the University of Melbourne, Richard Parncutt, an Australian- born professor of systematic musicology, endorsed the idea that music originally spawned from' motherese'- the playful voices mothers 【adopt】 when speaking to infants and toddlers. As the theory goes, increased human brain sizes caused by evolutionary changes occurring between one and 2, 000, 000 years ago resulted in earlier births, more fragile infants and a 【critical】 need for stronger relationships between mothers and their newborn babies. According to Parncutt, who is based at the University of Graz in Austria,' motherese' arose as a way to strengthen this maternal bond and to help 【ensure】 an infant's survival.

429.Important Corollary. 重要推论

An important corollary of this focus on language as the window to legal epistemology is the central role of 【discourse】 to law and other sociocultural processes. In particular, the 【ideas】 that people hold about how language works combine with 【linguistic】 structuring to create powerful, often unconscious effects. In recent years, linguistic anthropologists have made much progress in developing more precisely analytic tools for tracking those effects.

430.Origin of Species. 物种起源

In The Origin of Species, Darwin provided abundant evidence that life on Earth has evolved over time, and he proposed natural selection as the primary mechanism for that change. He observed that individuals 【differ】 in their inherited traits and that selection acts on such differences, leading to 【evolutionary】 change. Although Darwin realised that variation in heritable traits is a prerequisite for 【evolution】, he did not know precisely how organisms pass heritable traits to their offspring. Just a 【few】 years after Darwin published The Origin of Species, Gregor Mendel wrote a groundbreaking paper on inheritance in pea plants. 【In】 that paper, Mendel proposed a model of inheritance in which organisms transmit discrete heritable units, now called genes, to their offspring. 【Although】 Darwin did not know about genes, Mendel's paper set the stage 【for】 understanding the genetic differences on which evolution is based.

431.Modify Cultural Ideas. 修改文化观念

People modify cultural ideas in their minds, and sometimes they pass on the modified versions. Inevitably, there are unintentional modifications as well, partly because of straightforward error, and partly because inexplicit ideas are hard to 【convey】 accurately: there is no way to download them directly from one brain to another like computer programmes. 【Even】 native speakers of a language will not give identical definitions of every word. So it can be only rarely, if 【ever】, that two people hold precisely the same cultural idea in their minds. That is why, when the founder of a philosophical movement or a religion dies, or 【even before】, schisms typically happen. The movements' most devoted followers are often shocked to 【discover】 that they disagree about what its doctrines- really are.

432.Ancient Egypt Music. 古埃及音乐

Music was as important to the ancient Egyptians as it is in our modern society. Although it is thought that music played a role throughout the history of Egypt, those that 【study】 the Egyptian writings have discovered that music 【seemed】 to become more important in what is called the' pharaonic' 【period】 of their history. This was the 【time】 when the Egyptian dynasties of the pharaohs were 【established】, around 3100 BCE, and music was 【found in】 many parts of everyday Egyptian life.

433.Light Pollution. 光污染

The widespread use of artificial light in modern societies means that light pollution is an increasingly common feature of the environments humans inhabit. This type of pollution is 【exceptionally】 high in coastal regions of tropic and temperate zones, as these are areas of high rates of human population growth and settlement. Light pollution is a threat for many species that inhabit these locations, particularly those whose ecology or behaviour depends, 【in some way】, on natural cycles of light and dark. Artificial light is known to have detrimental effects on the ecology of sea turtles, particularly at the hatchling stage when they emerge from nests on natal beaches and head towards the sea. Under natural conditions, turtles hatch predominantly at night' although some early morning and late afternoon emergence occurs' and show an innate and well- directed orientation to the water, 【relying】 mostly on light cues that attract them toward the brighter horizon above the sea surface. Artificial lighting on beaches is strongly attractive to hatchlings and can cause 【them to move】 away from the sea and interfere with their ability to orient in a constant direction. Ultimately, this disorientation due to light pollution can lead to death of hatchlings from exhaustion, dehydration and predation.

434.Wagonways in Germany. 德国轨道马车

Roads of rails called Wagonways were being used in Germany as 【early】 as 1550. These 【primitive】 railed roads consisted of wooden rails over which horse- drawn waggons or carts moved with greater ease than over dirt roads. Wagonways were the beginnings of modern railroads. 【By】 1776, iron had replaced the wood in the rails and wheels on the carts. Wagonways evolved into Tramways and spread throughout Europe. Horses still provided all the pulling power. In 1789, Englishman, William Jessup designed the first waggons with flanged wheels. The 【flange】 was a groove that allowed the wheels to better grip the rail, this was an important design that carried over to later locomotives.

435.Kathryn Mewes. 凯瑟琳·缪斯

Kathryn Mewes does not meet bohemian, hippy parents in her line of work. Typically one, or both, of the parents she sees work in the City of London."Professionals seek professionals," she says. Originally a nanny, Mewes is now a parenting consultant, advising couples privately on changing their child's behaviour, 【as well as】 doing corporate seminars for working parents. Her clients find they are unprepared for the chaos and unpredictability that having a child can entail."Parents are getting older, and they have been in control of their 【whole】 lives and been successful. Suddenly a baby turns up and life turns on its head." Nicknamed the"Three- Day Nanny" 【because of】 her pledge to fix behavioural problems in children under the age of 12 within three days, she is filming a new Channel 4 television series demonstrating her techniques. The 【role】 of the parenting consultant- distinct from that of a nanny- has developed, she says, as people are used to buying in expertise, such as personal trainers or, in her case, parenting advice.

436.Great Engineers. 伟大工程师

Great engineers have a passion to improve life; a burning conviction that they can make life better for everyone. Engineers need to have a talent 【for】 invention and innovation, but 【what】 drives them is the conviction that they can find a better way to do things; a cheaper and more efficient solution 【to】 the problems of human existence on this planet of 【limited】 resources that we call Earth. Many of us spend a lot of time 【complaining】 about the difficulties and problems of life. It is easy to find fault with things that make daily life arduous. For an engineer, these difficulties can be opportunities. How can this be made 【to work】 better? How can that process be made more efficient? How can components be made more cheaply, more accurately and more fit- for- purpose? Great engineers are convinced that everything can be improved. Instead of complaining, they think of ways to make things better.

437.Bhutan. 不丹

Bhutan is the last standing Buddhist Kingdom in the World and, until recently, has preserved much 【of】 their culture since the 17 th century by avoiding globalisation and staying isolated from the world. Internet, television, and western dress were 【banned】 from the country up until ten years ago. But over the past ten years globalisation has begun to change in Bhutan, but things remain perfectly balanced. Bhutan is the only country in the world that has a' GNH.' You may think GNH is just another 【statistically】 based term with no real- life application, but it refers to"Gross National Happiness." The process of measuring GNH began when Bhutan opened to globalisation. It measures people's quality of life, and makes sure that"material and spiritual development happen together." Bhutan has done an amazing Job of finding this balance. Bhutan has continually been ranked as the happiest country in all of Asia, and the eighth Happiest Country in the world according to Business Week. In 2007 Bhutan had the second fastest growing GDP in the world, at the same time as 【maintaining】 their environment and cultural identity.

438.Dance. 舞蹈

Dance has played an important role in many musicals. In some 【cases】, dance numbers are included as an excuse to add to the colour and spectacle of the show, but dance is more effective when it forms an integral part of the 【plot】. An early example is Richard Rodgers On Your Toes' 1936' in which the story about classical ballet meeting the world of jazz enabled dance to be introduced in a way that 【enhances】, rather than interrupts the drama.

439.Stress. 压力

Stress- that tense feeling often connected to having too much to do, too many bills to pay and 【not enough】 time or money- is a common emotion that knows few 【borders】. About three- fourths of people in the United States, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, South Korea and Britain reported experiencing stress on a daily basis, according to AP- Ipsos 【polling】. Anxious feelings were more 【intense】 during the holidays. Germans feel stress more intensely than those in other countries polled. People in the United States cite financial pressures as the top worry. About half the people polled in Britain said they frequently or 【sometimes】 felt that life was beyond their control, the highest level in the 10 countries surveyed.

440.Sound Speed. 声速

The speed of sound' otherwise known as Mach 1' varies with temperature. At sea level on a' standard day', the temperature is 59 F, and Mach 1 is approximately 761 mph. As the altitude increases, the temperature and speed of sound 【both】 decrease until about 36, 000 feet, after which the temperature 【remains】 steady until about 60, 000 feet. Within that 36, 000- 60, 000 foot range, Mach 1 is about 661 mph. Because of the variation, it is possible for an aeroplane flying supersonic at high altitude to be slower than a subsonic flight at sea level. The transonic band"the' sound barrier'" extends 【from】 around Mach 0. 8- when the first supersonic shock waves 【form on】 the wing- to Mach 1. 2, when the entire wing has gone supersonic.

441.UWS. 西悉尼大学

UWS graduates Racha Abboud and Anna Ford, whose story first appeared in GradLife in December 2009, have 【successfully】 risen through the ranks to be 【appointed】 Associates at leading western Sydney law firm, Coleman Greig Lawyers. The promotion marks the 【culmination】 of many years of hard work for these legal 【eagles】 who are the first to rise to this 【level】 from the firm's Cadet Lawyer programme with UWS.

442.Tokyo Skytree. 东京晴空塔

Team Lab's digital mural at the entrance to Tokyo's Skytree, one of the world's monster skyscrapers, is 40 metres long and immensely detailed. 【However】 massive this form of digital art becomes- and it's a form 【subject to】 rampant inflation- Inoko's theories about seeing are based on more modest and often pre- digital sources. An early devotee of comic books and cartoons' no surprises there', then computer games, he recognised when he started to look at traditional Japanese art that all those forms had something 【in common】: something about the way they captured space. In his discipline of physics, Inoko had been taught that photographic lenses, along with the conventions of western art, were the logical way of transforming three dimensions into two, conveying the real world onto a flat surface. 【But】 Japanese traditions employed' a different spatial logic', as he said in an interview last year with j- collabo. org, that is' uniquely Japanese'.

443.Paris Opera. 巴黎歌剧院

Most important of all is the fact that for each new ballet- pantomime created at the Paris Opera during the July Monarchy, a new score was produced. The reason for this is simple: these ballet- pantomimes told stories- elaborate ones- and music was considered an indispensable tool in getting them across to the audience. 【Therefore】, music had to be newly created to fit each story. Music tailor- made for each new ballet- pantomime, however, was only one weapon in the Opera's explanatory arsenal. 【Another】 was the ballet- pantomime libretto, a printed booklet of fifteen to forty pages in length, which was sold in the Operas lobby like the opera libretto , and which laid out the plot in painstaking detail, scene by scene. Critics also took it upon themselves to recount the plots of both ballet- pantomimes and operas in their 【reviews】 of premieres. So did the publishers of souvenir albums, which also featured pictures of famous 【performers】 and of scenes from favourite ballet- pantomimes and operas.

444.Early Childhood Disadvantage. 幼儿期劣势

Disadvantage in early childhood poses multiple risks to children's development. Factors such as low socioeconomic status, long- term unemployment of parents, and social isolation may have lasting 【impacts】 on a child's chance of reaching their full potential. Whilst not eliminating disadvantage, preschool education can help to 【lessen】 the effects of these risk factors and can provide children with a better start to school. However, some of these factors may also be 【barriers】 to preschool attendance for groups that would benefit most from preschool education. In Australia, the early years of children's education is the responsibility of many government and non- government agencies and it occurs in a range of settings. Preschool is aimed at children around four years of age to 【prepare】 them for compulsory schooling from the age of six years. In most states and territories, children can start full- time schooling at five years of age, when they enrol in a kindergarten or preparatory year. In 2001, just over half of five- year olds' 57 %' were at school with about a third' 34 %' attending preschool. While in some states and territories children can 【commence】 preschool before they turn four, participation rates for three- year olds are much lower than four- year olds' 24 % compared with 56 % for four- year olds in 2001'. The preschool participation rate of four- year olds in 2001' 56 %' was similar to the rate in 1991' 58 %'.

445.Seminars. 研讨会

Seminars are not designed to be mini- lectures. Their educational 【role】 is to provide an opportunity for you to discuss interesting and difficult aspects of the course. This is founded on the 【assumption】 that it is only by actively trying to use the knowledge that you have acquired from lectures and texts that you can achieve an adequate understanding of the subject. If you do not understand a point it is highly 【unlikely】 that you will be the only person in the group in that position; you will invariably be undertaking a 【duty】 for the entire group if you come to the seminar equipped with questions on matters which you feel you did not fully understand. The seminar is to 【provoke】 discussion.

446.Wind Moving. 风的运动

Wind is air moving around. Some winds can move 【as】 fast as a racing car, over 100 miles an 【hour】. Winds can travel around the world. Wind can make you feel cold because you lose heat from your body 【faster】 when it is windy. Weather forecasters need to 【know】 the speed and direction of the wind. The strength of wind is measured using the Beaufort scale from wind force when there is no wind, to wind force 12 which can damage houses and buildings and is called hurricane force.

447.Scientific Method. 科学方法

The logic of the scientific method was set out by John Stuart Mill in 1843 and was 【named】 the method of difference. A simple example of what he 【meant】 by this is to take two glasses of water which are identical in every 【respect】. Introduce a few drops of ink into one of these glasses. The water changes colour! 【According】 to Mill's method of difference it is safe to 【assume】 that the change in the colour of the water is due to the 【introduction】 of a new factor- the independent variable- in this case, the ink.

448.European Culture. 欧洲文化

Many people today think of culture in the way that it was thought of in Europe during the 18 th and early 19 th centuries. This 【concept】 of culture reflected inequalities within European societies and their colonies around the world. This understanding of culture equates culture with civilization and contrasts both with nature or non- civilization. According to this understanding of culture, some countries are more civilised than others, and some people are more cultured than others. Anything that doesn't 【fit】 into this category is labelled as chaos or anarchy. From this perspective, culture is closely tied to cultivation, which is the progressive refinement of human 【behaviour】. In practise, culture referred to elite goods and activities such as haute cuisine, high fashion or haute couture, museum- calibre art and classical music. The word cultured referred to people who knew about and took part in these activities. For example, someone who used culture in this sense might 【argue】 that classical music is more refined than music by working- class people, such as jazz or the indigenous music traditions of aboriginal peoples.

449.The Growth of the Internet. 互联网的发展

The exponential growth of the internet was 【heralded】, in the 1990s, as revolutionising the production and 【dissemination】 of information. Some people saw the internet as a means of 【democratising】 access to knowledge. For people 【concerned】 with African development, it seemed to offer the possibility of 【leapfrogging】 over the technology gap that 【separates】 Africa from advanced industrialised countries.

450.Petrified Forest. 石化森林

The Petrified Forest is home to some of the most impressive fossils ever found and more are being discovered each year as erosion 【exposes】 new evidence. Fossils found here show the Forest was once a tropical region, 【filled with】 towering trees and extraordinary creatures we can only imagine. 【While】 more than 150 different species of fossilised plants have been discovered by palaeontologists, species of reptiles, such as Desmatosuchus, similar to the armadillo, have also been discovered. Archaeologists have found 【much】 evidence to indicate that ancient native people inhabited this region about 10, 000 years ago. Petroglyph drawings on rock surfaces, gives a glimpse of the past and you can see the marks of a solar calendar at Puerco Pueblo near the time of the summer solstice.

451.When to Revise? 何时修订？

Timing is important for revision. Have you noticed that during the school day you get times when you just don't care any longer? I don't mean the lessons you don't like, but the ones you usually find OK, but on some occasions, you just can't be bothered with it. You 【may】 have other things on your mind, be tired, restless or looking forward to what comes next. Whatever the reason, that particular lesson doesn't get 100 percent 【effort】 from you. The same is true of revision. Your mental and physical 【attitude】 is important. If you try to revise when you are tired or totally occupied with something else, your revision will be inefficient and just about worthless. If you approach it feeling fresh, alert and happy, it will be so much easier, and you will learn more, faster. However, if you make no plans and just slip in a little bit of revision when you feel like it, you probably won't do much revision! You need a revision timetable, so you don't keep 【putting it off】.

452.Computational Thinking. 计算思维

Developing computational thinking helps students to better understand the world around them. Many of us happily drive a car without understanding what 【goes on】 under the bonnet. So is it necessary for children to learn how to programme computers? 【After all】, some experts say coding is one of the human skills that will become obsolete as artificial intelligence grows. Nevertheless, governments believe coding is an essential skill. Since 2014, the principles of computer programming 【have featured】 on England's curriculum for children from the age of five or six, when they start primary school. While not all children will become programmers, Mark Martin, a computing teacher at Sydenham High School, London, argues that they should learn to understand what 【makes】 computers work and try to solve problems as a computer might.

453.Papal Reform. 教皇改革

Since the last papal reform, several 【proposals】 have been 【offered】 to make the Western calendar more useful or 【regular】. Very few reforms, such as the rather different decimal French Republican and Soviet calendars, had gained official 【acceptance】, but each was put out of use shortly after its introduction.

454.Looking Trustworthy. 看起来可信

It would be reassuring to think that the electorate choose who to vote for based on the candidates' track records and future policy promises. 【In truth】, many of us are swayed simply by the way that politicians look. Consider a 2009 study that asked Swiss students to look at multiple pairs of unfamiliar French political candidates and in each case to select the one who looked most competent. Most of the time, the candidate selected by students 【as】 looking the most competent was also the one who'd had real life electoral success, the implication 【being】 that voters too had been swayed by the candidates' appearance( there's little evidence that appearance and competence actually 【correlate】). Unsurprisingly, being attractive also helps win votes, especially in war time( in peace time, looking trustworthy is more of an advantage). Other research has shown that we're more likely to vote for male and female candidates with deeper voices.

455.Dictionary. 词典

The famous dictionary of Samuel Johnson, published in London in 1755; its principles dominated English 【lexicography】 for more than a century. This two- volume work surpassed earlier dictionaries not in 【bulk】 but in the precision of definition. Its strength lay in two features: the original carefully divided and ordered, elegantly formulated definitions of the main word stock of the language; and the copious citation of quotations from the entire range of English literature, which served in support and illustration and which 【exemplified】 the different shades of meaning of a particular word. A Dictionary of the English Language included a history of the language, a grammar, and an extensive list of words representing basic general vocabulary, based on the best conversation of 【contemporary】 London and the normal usage of respected writers. The original was followed in 1756 by an abbreviated one- volume version that was widely used far into the 20th century. Johnson's accomplishment was to provide for the English language a dictionary that incorporated with skill and intellectual power the 【prevailing】 ideals and resources and the best available techniques of European lexicography. It was the standard English dictionary until Noah Webster's

456.Giant Exoplanets. 巨型系外行星

Giant exoplanets, like the so- called' hot Jupiters' that are similar in 【characteristics】 to the solar system's biggest 【planet】 and orbit very close to their host stars, are excellent targets for 【astronomers】 in their search for their extrasolar worlds. The size and proximity of these planets is easy to 【detect】 as they create a large decrease in brightness when passing in front of their parent stars.

457.Melting Ice. 融冰

At the end of the last ice age, the melting ice disrupted the ocean currents in the North Atlantic and 【caused】 a drop in temperature of almost 5 degrees. 【Even though】 the rest of the planet was warming 【up】, the North Atlantic region remained in a cold period for 1300 years. The same thing happened 【around】 8000 years ago, when the cooling lasted about a hundred years, and it 【could】 happen again today. Even a short period of cooling in the North Atlantic could have a dramatic effect on the wildlife, and the human populations, living there.

458.Carski Award. 卡斯基奖

In 2001 he received the SIUC Outstanding Scholar Award. In 2003 he received the Carski Award for Distinguished Undergraduate Teaching from the American Society for Microbiology. Mike's research is 【focused】 on bacteria that inhabit 【extreme】 environments, and for the past 12 years he has studied the microbiology of permanently ice- covered lakes in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica. In addition to his research papers, he has edited a major 【treatise】 on phototrophic bacteria and served for over a decade as chief editor of the 【journal】 Archives of Microbiology. He currently serves on the editorial board of Environmental Microbiology. Mike's non-scientific 【interests】 include forestry, reading, and caring for his dogs and horses. He lives beside a peaceful and quiet lake with his wife, Nancy, five shelter dogs, Gaino, Snuffy, Pepto, Peanut, and Merry , and four horses, Springer, Feivel, Gwen, and Festus.

459.Selfies. 自拍

To better understand selfies and how people form their identities online, the researchers combed through 2. 5 million selfie posts 【on】 Instagram to determine what kinds of identity statements people make by taking and sharing the photos. Nearly 52 percent of all selfies 【fell】 into the appearance category: pictures of people showing off their make- up, clothes, lips, etc. 【Overall】, an overwhelming 57 percent of selfies on Instagram were posted by the 18- 35- year- old crowd, something the researchers say isn't too surprising 【considering】 the demographics of the social media platform. The under- 18 age group posted about 30 percent of selfies.

460.Bizarre Universe. 奇异宇宙

It seems we live in a bizarre universe. One of the greatest mysteries in the whole of science is the prospect that 75% of the Universe is made up from a mysterious 【substance】 known as' Dark Energy', which causes an acceleration of the cosmic expansion. Since a further 21% of the Universe is made up from invisible' Cold Dark Matter' that can only be 【detected】 through its gravitational effects, the ordinary atomic matter making up the rest is apparently only 4% of the total cosmic budget. These 【discoveries】 require a shift in our perception as great as that made after Copernicus' 【revelation】 that the Earth moves around the Sun. This lecture will start by reviewing the chequered history of Dark Energy, not only since Einstein's proposal for a similar entity in 1917, but by tracing the concept back to Newton's ideas. This lecture will 【summarise】 the current evidence for Dark Energy and future surveys in which UCL is heavily involved: the' Dark Energy Survey', the Hubble Space Telescope and the proposed Euclid space mission.

461.Gas Drilling. 天然气钻探

Gas drilling on the Indonesian of java has 【triggered】 a"mud volcano" that has killed 13 people and may render four square miles, ten square kilometres, of countryside uninhabitable for years. In a report released on January 23, a team of British researchers says the deadly 【upwelling】 began when an exploratory gas well punched through a layer of rock 9300 feet, 2800 metres, below the surface, 【allowing】 hot, high- pressure water to 【escape】. The water 【carried】 mud to the surface, where it has 【spread】 across a region 2.5 miles, 4 kilometres, in 【diameter】 in the eight months since the eruption began. The mud volcano is similar to a gusher or blowout, which occurs in oil drilling when oil or gas squirt to the surface, the team says. This upwelling, however, spews out a volume of mud equivalent to a dozen Olympic swimming pools each day. Although the eruption isn't as violent as a 【conventional】 volcano, more than a dozen people died when a natural gas pipeline ruptured. The research team, who published their findings in the February issue of GSA Today, also estimate that the volcano, called Lusi, will leave more than 11, 000 people permanently displaced.

462.Shrimp Farm. 养虾场

Over the past two decades around a third of the world's mangrove swamps have been 【converted】 for human use, with many turned into valuable shrimp farms. In 2007 an economic study of such shrimp farms in Thailand showed that the commercial profits per hectare were 9, 632. If that were the only 【factor】, conversion would seem an excellent idea. However, proper 【accounting】 shows that for each hectare government subsidies formed 8, 412 of this figure and there were costs, too: 1, 000 for pollution and 12, 392 for losses to ecosystem services. These 【comprised】 damage to the supply of foods and medicines that people had taken from the forest, the loss of habitats for fish, and less buffering against storms. And because a given shrimp farm only stays 【productive】 for three or four years, there was the additional cost of restoring them afterwards: if you do so with mangroves themselves, add another 9, 318 per hectare. The overall lesson is that what looks 【beneficial】 only does so because the profits are retained by the private sector, while the problems are spread out across society at large, appearing on no specific balance sheet.

463.Private Schools. 私立学校

Private schools in the UK are redoubling their marketing efforts to foreigners. Almost a third of the 68, 000 boarding pupils at such schools 【already】 come from overseas. But now, with many UK residents 【unwilling】 or unable to afford the fee- top boarding schools 【edging】 towards 30, 000 a year- and a cultural 【shift】 away from boarding, many schools are looking abroad to survive. Overseas students now 【account】 for about 500 m of fee income a year for boarding schools in the UK.

464.Green Spaces. 绿色空间

Green spaces contribute significantly to a 【reduction】 in soil and aerial temperatures during spells of hot weather, so contributing to human wellbeing. In the garden 【context】, there is, however, little information as to what extent various types of plants 【differ】 in their cooling potential and how certain planting combinations may maximise cooling under a scenario of 【low】 rainfall and minimal water inputs.

465.Supply and Demand. 供需

The supply of a thing, in the phrase"supply and demand", is the amount that will be offered for sale at each of a series of prices; the demand is the amount that will be bought at each of a series of prices. The principle that value depends on supply and demand means that in the case of nearly every commodity, more will be bought if the price is lowered, less will be bought if the price is 【raised】. Therefore sellers, if they wish to induce buyers to 【take】 more of a commodity than they are already doing, must 【reduce】 its price; if they raise its price, they will sell less. If there is a general falling off, if in demand- due, say, to trade depression- sellers will either have to reduce prices or put less on the 【market】; they will not be able to sell the same 【amount】 at the same price.

466.Behavior Segments. 行为细分

One of the most 【eminent】 of psychologists, Clark Hull, claimed that the essence of reasoning lies in the putting together of two' behaviour segments' in some 【novel】 way, never actually performed before, so as to reach a 【goal】. Two followers of Clark Hull, Howard and Tracey Kendler, devised a test for children that was 【explicitly】 based on Clark Hull's principles. The children were given the 【task】 of learning to operate a machine so as to get a toy. In order to succeed they had to go through a two- stage sequence.

467.Bach. 巴赫

Those were his halcyon days when his music was constantly heard in Venice, and his influence 【blanketed】 Europe. He spent much of his time on the road, 【performing】 and overseeing productions of his music. In Germany, Bach studied Vivaldi's scores, copied them for performance and 【arranged】 some for other instruments.

468.Genius. 天才

Genius, in the popular conception, is inextricably tied up with precocity- doing something truly creative, we're inclined to think, requires the freshness and exuberance and energy of youth. Orson Welles made his masterpiece,"Citizen Kane", at twenty- five. Herman Melville wrote a book a year 【through】 his late twenties, culminating, at the 【age】 of thirty- two, with"Moby- Dick". Mozart wrote his breakthrough Piano Concerto No. 9 in E- Flat- Major at the age of twenty- one. In some creative forms, like lyric poetry, the 【importance】 of precocity has hardened into an iron law. How old was T. S. Eliot when he wrote"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock"("I grow old... I grow old")? Twenty- three."Poets peak young," the creativity researcher James Kaufman maintains. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, the author of"Flow", agrees:"The most creative lyric verse is believed to be that written by the young." According to the Harvard psychologist Howard Gardner, a leading 【authority】 on creativity,"Lyric poetry is a domain where 【talent】 is discovered early, burns brightly, and then peters out at an early age."

469.Basic Organisms. 基础生物

Some of the most basic organisms are smarter than we thought. Rather than moving about randomly, amoebas and plankton employ sophisticated 【strategies】 to look for food and might travel in a way that optimises their foraging. Biophysicists have 【long】 tried to explain how creatures of all sizes search for food. However, single- celled organisms such as bacteria seem to move in no particular direction in their search. To investigate, Liang Li and Edward Cox at Princeton University studied the movements of amoebas( Dictyostelium) in a Petri dish, recording the paths travelled by 12 amoebas, including every turn and movement straight ahead, for 8 to 10 hours per amoeba. Immediately after an amoeba turned right, it was twice as 【likely】 to turn left as right again, and vice versa, they told a meeting of the American Physical Society meeting in Denver, Colorado, last week. This suggests that the cells have a 【rudimentary】 memory being able to remember the last direction they had just turned in, says Robert Austin, a biophysicist at Princeton who was not involved in the study.

470.Stressors. 压力源

Research has suggested that major stressors in our lives are life 【changes】, for example, moving house, marriage or relationship breakdown. Work- related factors, 【including】 unemployment and boredom, are also common 【causes】 of stress. Differences in personality may also 【play】 a part.

471.Human Brain. 人类大脑

We now know through the work of neuroscientists that the human brain is wired to mimic other people, and this mimicry involves actual involuntary physiological 【experience】 in the observer. Human beings tend to 【imitate】 actions that they see. Physiologically, our brains include mirror neurons, which 【react】 to actions that are seen as if we are doing the action ourselves. It is largely an unconscious and automatic experience. When we hear people speak, observe their vocal 【nuances】, watch their posture, gestures, and facial expressions, etc, neural networks in our brains are stimulated by the' shared representations' generating feelings within us that 【reflect】 the experience of those we are observing.

472.Repeated Syllables. 重复音节

Assessments of language learning in 18- month- olds suggest that children are better at grasping the names of objects with repeated syllables, over words with non- identical syllables. Researchers say the study may help explain 【why】 some words or phrases, such as' train' and' good night', have given rise to versions with repeated syllables, such as choo- choo and night- night. The researchers say such words are easier for infants to learn, and may provide them 【with】 a starter point for vocabulary learning. A team from the University of Edinburgh assessed the infants' language learning behaviour in a series of visual and attention tests 【using】 pictures on a computer screen of two unfamiliar objects. The two objects were named with made- up words which were 【communicated】 to the infants by a recorded voice- one with two identical syllables, for example neenee, and the other without repeated syllables, such as bolay. The infants were then tested for their recognition of 【each】 made- up word. Recordings of their eye movements showed they looked more reliably at the object labelled with repeated syllables, than the other object. Researchers validated their results with a control test, in which the infants responded to pictures of familiar objects- such as a dog or an apple.

473.Dog Emotion. 狗的情绪

Can dogs tell when we are happy, sad or angry? As a dog owner, I feel 【confident】 not only that I can tell what kind of 【emotional】 state my pets are in, but also that they respond to my emotions. Yet as a hard- headed scientist, I try to take a more 【rational】 and pragmatic view. These 【personal】 observations seem more likely to result from my desire for a good relationship with my dogs.

474.Kashmiri. 克什米尔人

Two decades ago, Kashmiri houseboat- owners rubbed their hands every spring at the prospect of the annual influx of 【tourists】. From May to October, the hyacinth- choked 【waters】 of Dal Lake saw flotillas of vividly painted Shikaras carrying Indian families, boho westerners, young travellers and wide- eyed Japanese. Carpet- sellers 【honed】 their skills, as did purveyors of anything remotely embroidered while the house boats initiated by the British Raj provided unusual accommodation. Then, in 1989, separatist and Islamist militancy 【attacked】 and everything changed. Hindus and countless Kashmiri business people bolted, at least 35, 000 people were killed in a decade, the lake stagnated, and the houseboats rotted. Any foreigners venturing there risked their 【lives】, proved in 1995 when five young Europeans were kidnapped and murdered.

475.Healthcare. 医疗保健

In the fast- changing world of modern healthcare, the job of a doctor is more like the job of chief executive. The people who run hospitals and physicians' practices don't just need to know 【medicine】. They must also be able to balance budgets, motivate a large and diverse 【staff】 and make difficult marketing and legal 【decisions】.

476.Sun and Moon. 太阳与月亮

From the time of the very earliest civilisations man has wondered about the world he lives in, about how it was created and about how it will end. In these distant times the sun was seen to make its daily 【journey】 across the sky. At night the moon appeared. Every new night the moon waxed or waned a little and on a few nights it did not appear at all. At night the great dome of the heavens was dotted with tiny specks of light. They 【became】 known as the stars. It was thought that every star in the heavens had its own purpose and that the 【secrets】 of the universe could be discovered by making a study of them. It was well known that there were wandering stars, they appeared in different nightly positions against their neighbours and they became known as planets. It took centuries, in fact it took millennia, for man to 【determine】 the true nature of these wandering stars and to evolve a model of the world to accommodate them and to 【predict】 their positions in the sky.

477.Fossil Fuels. 化石燃料

But look beyond fossil fuels for the most intriguing trends. One is that the energy intensity of the world economy- the amount of energy it takes to produce one dollar's 【worth】 of income- keeps falling, at a rate of about 2 percent. What this means is that even without any change in the 【relative】 shares of fossil- based and fossil- free sources in the world's energy mix, we could have 2 percent annual economic growth without increasing carbon emissions from energy use. Of course that is not enough to 【address】 climate change and we need more economic growth than that. It is 【nonetheless】 a stunning number, which refutes the claim by some environmentalists that permanent economic growth is fundamentally incompatible 【with】 finite physical resources.

478.Forces of Globalization. 全球化力量

Forces of globalisation have acted on education internationally, creating greater standardisation in norms of teaching and learning. There has always been 【considerable】 similarity between schools across context: the curriculum, for example has been shown 【to be divided】 between language, mathematics, science and the arts in a comparable way in schools around the world. Likewise, school buildings in terms of their architecture share remarkable similarities internationally, 【as a result】 of shared patterns of teaching and learning( although facilities and resources differ significantly.) In recent years, globalisation has created increased opportunities for the' borrowing' of education policy and practise, and 【generated】 further uniformity across national contexts. Nowhere has the internationalisation of education been more apparent than in the higher education sector. The move to the internationalisation of higher- education policy and practise 【was initially driven】 by increased student mobility, and the desire of universities to attract students from overseas.

479.Coastal Fish Farms. 沿海养鱼场

Coastal fish farms seem to do less harm to nearby plants and animals than 【previously】 believed, a new study reveals. And marine ecosystems can 【recover】 from this damage 【surprisingly】 fast. But the analysis of a single trout farm internationally renowned in a Faroe Islands fjord over nearly a year also shows that these facilities need to be 【placed】 carefully, and that there's a limit to how many can operate in a particular area before its biodiversity suffers lasting harm. In coastal farms, fish live in large cages hanging from pontoons on the surface. Fish faeces and uneaten food sink to the seabed, affecting its ecosystem. 【Badly】 managed farms can also have serious effects on the surrounding water column.

480.Noisy Studying. 嘈杂学习环境

Some students say that they need complete quiet to read and study. Others study best in a crowded, noisy room because the noise actually 【helps】 them concentrate. Some students like quiet music playing; others 【do】 not. The point is, you should know the level of noise that is optimal for your own studying. However, one general rule for all students is that the television seems to be more of a distraction than music or other background noise, so 【leave】 the TV off when you are reading or studying. 【Also】, don't let yourself become distracted by computer games, email, or Internet surfing.

481.Wrinkle Cure. 皱纹治疗

Barrie Finning's a professor at Monash University's college of pharmacy in Melbourne, and PhD student Anita Schneider, recently tested a new wrinkle cure. Twice daily, 20 male and female volunteers applied a liquid containing Myoxinol, a patented 【extract】 of okra( Hibiscus esculentus) seed, to one side of their faces. On the other side they applied a similar liquid without Myoxinol. Every week for a month their wrinkles were tested by self- assessment, photography and the size of depressions made in silicon moulds. The results were impressive. After a month the 【depth】 and number of wrinkles on the Myoxinol- treated side were reduced by approximately 27 per cent. But Finnin's research, commissioned by a cosmetics company, is unlikely to be published in a scientific 【publication】. It's hard to even find studies that show the active ingredients in cosmetics penetrate the skin, let alone more comprehensive research on their effects. Even when 【rigorous】 studies are commissioned, companies usually control whether the work is published in the traditional scientific literature.

482.Electrons. 电子

The electrons that orbit closest to the nucleus are 【strongly】 attracted. They are called bound electrons. The electrons that are farther away from the pull of nucleus can be forced out of their orbits. These are called free electrons. Free electrons can move from one atom to another. This movement is known as electron flow. Electricity is the movement or flow of electrons from one atom to another. A 【condition】 of imbalance is necessary to have a movement of electrons. In a 【normal】 atom, the positively charged nucleus balances the negatively charged electrons. This holds them in orbit. If an atom loses electrons, it becomes positive in charge. It attracts more electrons in order to get its balance. A conductor is any 【material】 that allows a good electron flow and conducts electricity. A good conductor must be made of atoms that give off free electrons easily. Also, the atoms must be close enough to each other so that the free electron orbits 【overlap】. Ignition systems use copper and aluminium wires to conduct electricity. They allow good electron flow.

483.Fire. 火

Some scientists say the use of fire helped make us modern humans-it dramatically changed what and how we eat and may have even altered our anatomy. But University of Utah anthropologist Polly Wielder thinks that fire was also important in shaping human social interactions and cultural 【traditions】. Her conclusions are in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Wiessner evaluated day and night activities and 【conversations】 of Bushmen from Botswana and Namibia. These communities still live by hunting and gathering, as most humans did over 【evolutionary】 history. During the day, nearly a third of the conversations dealt with economic issues such as hunting strategies and foraging plans. Another third covered complaints, criticisms and gossip. But at night around the fire, more than 80 percent of group conversations were storytelling, often about people living far away or in the spirit world. Weissner says that humans are unique in that we create ties to others outside of our immediate group. Gathering at the fire 【expanded】 listeners' imaginations and allowed for the development of cognitive processes that made it possible to form those links to distant communities. Which makes fire the precursor to Facebook.

484.ICU. 重症监护室

Having a loved one in the hospital, especially the Intensive Care Unit, or ICU, can be a 【harrowing】 experience. And it's even more traumatic for the families of those who pass away. Or so you'd think. But according to a study published in the November issue of the journal Chest, families whose loved ones die in the ICU tend to be more satisfied with the 【care】 they received than those whose loved ones survive. Although the results seem paradoxical, when you look more closely at how people define"quality of care," they do make sense. All patients who 【wind】 up in the ICU, whether or not they walk out, receive a similar standard of care from a 【strictly】 medical point of view. But doctors, nurses, and other hospital staff may devote extra time and attention to the needs of families whose loved ones are near the end. That compassion is what families who lose a loved one are responding to when they report a more satisfactory ICU experience. Just having someone who'll explain what's going on, answer their questions and offer 【emotional】 support makes all the difference. An observation that, in the end, is maybe not so surprising.

485.WorldWide Telescope. 全球望远镜

If you've ever wanted to explore the universe, your dream is now as close as your keyboard. Because last week, Microsoft unveiled its online WorldWide Telescope. The programme was developed in partnership with NASA and research institutions such as the California Institute of Technology. The WorldWide Telescope uses the best high- resolution imagery that's been 【generated】 both here on earth and in space. The images are joined together to put celestial objects in the correct perspective and in their actual 【positions】 in the sky. From your computer, you can peer through telescopes such as the Hubble or the Chandra X- Ray Observatory. You can roam on your own through the galaxies, get up close and 【personal】 with the planets, or take tours 【guided】 by astronomers and professors. You can choose to look through different wavelengths of light to reveal hidden structures. And you can explore the heavens not only as they are today, but as they were in the past or will be in the future. The late Jim Grey, a Microsoft computer scientist, conceived of this effort as a way to make the universe accessible to everyone. The free programme can be 【downloaded】 at worldwidetelescope. org.

486.Natural-born Runners. 天生跑者

You've probably had the feeling. Your running shoes are pounding the pavement- then suddenly your pain fades away, and you're feeling euphoric. The runner's high. But that biological perk may be limited to mammals that evolved for endurance 【exercise】- like us. So says a study in the Journal of Experimental Biology. Researchers had humans and dogs- both natural- born runners- jog a half hour on a treadmill. Then they sampled their blood for endocannabinoids, some of the 【compounds】 thought to trigger the runner's high. As expected, humans and dogs had much higher levels after the run. But when ferrets- a 【sedentary】 species- took the same 30- minute trot, they had no spike in those 【feel-good】 molecules. The authors say that's because long- distance running could have helped our hunter- gatherer ancestors find more food- thus increasing their reproductive success. And they speculate that natural selection may have linked up a feel- good reward to that beneficial 【behaviour】. These days of course, this ancient trait won't help us find extra calories- but it may encourage us to run' em off.

487.Smoking Happiness. 吸烟幸福感

On March 18 th, we told you that smoking doesn't make people happy. Well, we hear you ask, what will make me happy? What? What?! Ok, first, relax. Then, take out your wallet. Because 【according】 to a study published in the March 21 st issue of Science, giving money to other people is what brings us joy. Scientists from Boston and British Columbia got to wondering whether money really can buy happiness. They were 【bothered】 by the fact that over the past 20 or 30 years, people in the US and other developed countries have been making much more money- yet our happiness has pretty much 【flatlined】. What they found is that money can buy happiness. But only when you spend it on someone else. In one experiment, the scientists asked volunteers to 【rate】 their happiness. Then they gave each subject some cash, either 5 or 20 dollars. Half the 【participants】 were told to spend the money on themselves. The others were asked to give it away. At the end of the day, the folks who got the biggest boost were the ones who spread the wealth, even if it was only five bucks. So if you want to be happy, here's a big tip: always leave a big tip.

488.Losing Weight. 减肥

Losing weight is no walk in the park. Although a walk in the park wouldn't hurt. Seems no matter what diet you try, those 【stubborn】 love handles just won't go away. Part of the problem is that the bulk of your bulk is stored inside fat cells. And the number of fat cells you have is set before you reach adulthood. So if you chunked up as a child, that battalion of fat cells is with you for life. It's enough to make you want to bury your face in a tray of 【brownies】, I know. But hold off. Because researchers from Stockholm think they've found a loophole. The Swedish scientists confirmed that even after massive weight loss, the number of fat cells an adult has remains the same. But they 【discovered】 that individual fat cells don't last a 【lifetime】. Each year, about 10 percent of them die off. Of course new fat cells take their place, findings that appear in the online issue of the journal Nature. While that might not seem like a major victory, if scientists can figure out how to stop the 【replacement】 fat cells from being born, that would tip the scales in your favour. So you might just be able to have your cake and eat it too, and still fit into your pants.

489.Clown Fish. 小丑鱼

Clown fish became famous thanks to the movie Finding Nemo. In real life, their social hierarchy is simple: larger fish dominate their smaller 【counterparts】. Now we know that to reinforce this social structure, the fish communicate with aggressive and submissive audio signals. The new info is in the journal PLoS ONE. Researchers 【recorded】 clown fish calls, 【capturing】 this noise as one chased a smaller fish. These popping sounds function as an aggression signal. When a clown fish has been chased and wishes to submit, it shakes its head in a submissive gesture and produces clicking noises like these. The researchers 【compared】 the aggressive and submissive calls, and found that the sound pulses in a submissive signal were shorter and more high- pitched. Unlike many animals that use sound to draw in 【potential】 mates, clown fish appear to use their calls only as labels of social status. When a little fish makes submissive sounds to a larger one, neither has to invest in a physical confrontation. Which is good news for small- fry like Nemo.

490.Body Energy. 身体能量

If you've ever had to pick up and carry a tired child through the mall, you know that walking sometimes tuckers out the 【toddlers】. Now scientists think they know why. The results appear in the Journal of Experimental Biology. Larger animals tend to use less energy per gramme of body 【mass】 than smaller ones do, even at rest. But what happens when they're in motion? Researchers 【recruited】 walkers of different ages and sizes, from a three- foot- tall kindergartner to a six- foot adult. While the subjects logged miles on the treadmill, the scientists 【measured】 their stride and metabolism. And they found that people pretty much walk the same way, regardless of their stature. If you scaled a five- year- old up to be six- and- a- half feet tall, the giant child would lope along just like a similarly sized adult. What's more, walkers of all heights use the same amount of energy per step. That means that big people don't 【conserve】 energy by strolling in a more economical style. They expend less energy because- just as you may have always suspected- they simply need fewer strides to cover the same ground. Which means that for some people a walk in the park ain't necessarily a walk in the park.

491.Financial Institutions. 金融机构

The economic 【dimension】 of globalisation involves international financial institutions i. e. the IMF- WB. Stabilisation and adjustment are sponsored by the two respectively and are rooted in the ideology of the free market. At the other end of the spectrum, protesters see globalisation in a very different light than the treasury secretary of the United States, or the finance or trade ministers of most of the advanced industrial countries. The difference in 【views】 is so great that one wonders, are the protesters and the policy makers talking about the same 【phenomenon】? Are they looking at the same data? Are the visions of those in 【power】 so clouded by special and particular 【interests】?

492.Culturomics. 文化组学

They call it culturomics: the obvious play on the word"genomics" looks at trends in human thought and culture. But scientists say culturomics has been hampered by a lack of quantitative data. So researchers at Harvard, along with Google, Encyclopaedia Britannica, and the 【American】 Heritage Dictionary, have come up with a new tool. It's a database of 5. 2 million books, published since the year 1500. That's four percent of all the books ever published, with a total of 500 billion words. The focus is on English language culture, so three quarters of the books are in English. Among the first findings of the research, published in the journal Science: about, 8500 new words enter the English language annually. But many of them don't end up in 【dictionaries】. And about fame- actors become famous around age 30, writers around 40, and politicians around 50. But the fame of politicians can 【eventually】 exceed that of actors. A Google tool called the Books Ngram Viewer is 【available】 based on this data- users can track the usage and 【frequency】 of a word or phrase over the past few centuries. Thus, we can watch the fall and rise of Melville. And soon the rise and fall of Snooki.

493.Sci-fi Movie. 科幻电影

It's like the publishing version of one of those scenes from a sci- fi movie where an alien invasion impels traditional adversaries to join together to face their larger, common threat. Today 56 newspapers, in Pakistan and India, in Israel and Lebanon, in China, in Greece and Turkey, in Africa and in North, South and Central America are publishing an unprecedented joint editorial calling for meaningful action to face the threat posed by climate change. The editorial, 【published】 in 45 【countries】 in 20 different languages, appears on this first day of the Copenhagen climate conference. The British paper the Guardian led the effort, which involved weeks of negotiations to reach a final version. The editorial notes that"the science is complex but the facts are clear. The world needs to take steps to limit temperature rises to 2 degrees C. A bigger rise of 3 to 4 degrees C would parch continents, turning farmland into desert. Half of all species could become extinct, untold millions of people would be displaced, whole nations drowned by the sea. The controversy over emails by British researchers that suggest they tried to suppress inconvenient data has muddied the waters but failed to dent the mass of evidence on which these predictions are based." The editorial 【recognised】 that"the shift to a low- carbon society holds out the prospect of more opportunity than sacrifice. Already some countries have recognised that embracing the transformation can bring growth, jobs and better quality lives. The flow of capital tells its own story: last year for the first time more was invested in renewable forms of energy than producing 【electricity】 from fossil fuels." So while gleeful anarchists like Oklahoma Senator James Inhofe go to Copenhagen to try to sabotage the proceedings, the worldwide array of newspapers attempts to remind the conference participants and the people they represent to keep their eye on the ball- the ball in this case being an oblate spheroid with almost seven billion human inhabitants and a fever that 【desperately】 needs to be treated. As the Guardian's editor in chief, Alan Rusbridger, said,"Newspapers have never done anything like this before but they have never had to cover a story like this before."

494.Wind. 风

The world's atmosphere is forever on the move. Wind is air in motion. Sometimes air moves slowly, giving a gentle breeze. At other times it moves rapidly, creating gales and hurricanes. 【Gentle】 or fierce, wind always starts in the same way. As the sun moves through the sky, it heats up some parts of the sea and land more than others. The air above these 【hot】 spots is warmed, becomes lighter than the surrounding air, and begins to rise. Elsewhere, cool air sinks, because it is 【heavier】. Winds blow because air squeezed out by sinking, cold air is sucked in under rising, warm air. Winds will blow wherever there is a 【difference】 in air temperature and pressure, always flowing from high to low pressure. Some winds blow in one place, and have a local name- North America's chinook and France's mistral. Others are part of a huge circulation pattern that sends winds over the 【entire】 globe.

495.Food Choices. 食物选择

Everybody eats. And consumers increasingly try to consider the 【environmental】 effects of their food choices. For example, if you want to eat meat, how do your choices compare? That's what a group of researchers set out to 【discover】. And they found that raising one animal is dramatically more environmentally draining than all the others: cows. The research is in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The scientists noted the challenge in accessing data and creating metrics that can be compared across livestock and to potato, wheat and rice 【production】. They settled on national data from the U. S. Departments of Agriculture, the Interior and Energy. The team calculated the production costs by assessing land area, water needs and fertiliser. They also analysed greenhouse gas 【emissions】. Producing pork, poultry, eggs and dairy were between two and six times less efficient than growing potatoes, wheat and rice. And in the current 【agricultural】 system, beef uses 28 times more land, 11 times more water and six times more fertiliser than the average of the other categories of livestock. Cattle ranching also creates five times more greenhouse gas emissions. The researchers hope this data will help consumers make informed choices and policy makers create systems that can reduce the environmental costs of what we eat.

496.Brain. 大脑

For decades, scientists have used an imaging technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, to 【chronicle】 the brain in action. But a study in the January 22 nd issue of Nature suggests that fMRI might show more than what the brain is doing- it might reveal what the brain's about to do. FMRI studies assume that blood flow in the brain 【correlates】 with neuronal activity. Active brain cells need 【nutrients】, which are brought to the cells by freshly oxygenated blood. But in the new study, scientists found that fMRI also detects 【increased】 blood flow in brain regions that aren't active- but that may be in the near future. The researchers trained monkeys to perform a specific visual task. And they found that, even when the animals were sitting in the dark waiting for the test to begin, fMRI nevertheless revealed an increased blood flow to the monkeys' visual cortex. The study suggests that fMRI data may be a lot more interesting than we thought. Scientists may be looking at their imaging data in a way that's too simplistic. And fMRI may not be measuring exactly what we thought it did. What will they think of next? Maybe fMRI can tell.

497.Good Customer Service. 优质客户服务

Good customer service relates to the service you and your employees provide before, during and after a purchase. For example, it's how you 【interact】 with your customers. Improving your customer service skills can lead to great customer satisfaction and a more enjoyable experience for them. No matter the size of your business, good customer service needs to be at the heart of your business model if you wish to be successful. it is important to provide good customer service; to all types of customers, including 【potential】, new and existing customers. Although it can take extra resources, time and money, good customer service leads to customer satisfaction which can generate positive 【word of mouth】 for your business, keep your customers happy and encourage them to purchase things from your business again. Good customer service can help your business grow and prosper.

498.Neutrinos. 中微子

In June 1998, an international team of Japanese and US physicists unveiled strong evidence that elusive subatomic particles known as neutrinos have mass. These findings run 【counter】 to the standard model of particle physics- the basic theory about the structure of matter- which holds that these electrically neutral, weakly interacting particles have no mass. The discovery means that existing theoretical models of matter must now be 【revised】 to include neutrinos with mass. Neutrinos occur in three states: electron, muon, and tau, with the names signifying what is produced when a neutrino collides with another particle. 【Observers】 do not see the neutrinos themselves, but can detect the creation of electrons and muons from faint flashes of light following a particle collision. The physicists used the giant Super- Kamiokande- the world's biggest neutrino detector buried deep underground in Mozumi, Japan. In the experiment, 【submerged】 in a 50, 000- tonne tank of purified water, neutrinos created when cosmic rays bombard Earth's upper atmosphere were counted relative to the number expected to penetrate the cavern. The experimenters found that the number of electron-neutrinos detected was relatively constant with theorised totals, while the number of muon-neutrinos was significantly lower. This indicated that they were disappearing into another state, or"flavour," such as an undetected tau- neutrino, or possibly another type.

499.Counterfeit Wines. 假冒葡萄酒

Here are two 【seemingly】 unrelated facts. One: from the late 1940 s through 1963, we tested atomic bombs in the atmosphere. Two: wine lovers are sometimes duped into 【spending】 exorbitant amounts for fake vintage bottles that weren't from the year they were supposedly grown. But Graham Jones at Australia's University of Adelaide thought he could use bomb information against counterfeit wines. Carbon dating works by comparing the amount of carbon 14, which is a less common and less stable form of carbon, to the more abundant carbon 12. For 【thousands】 of years, the ratio between the two has been the same. But those two decades of atomic bomb tests increased the C- 14 in the atmosphere. And as growing grapes absorb carbon dioxide, they take in trace amounts of the heavier carbon isotope- which eventually show up in the wine. The 【research】 team checked C- 14 levels in 20 Australian red wines with vintages from 1958 to 1997. They compared the wine's C- 14 to C- 14 in 【atmospheric】 samples from the same years, and found a direct match- C- 14 levels could give away the vintage year for each wine. So beware of wine scammers. Because even at the atomic level, in vino veritas.

500.Text. 文本

This text delivers a thorough and balanced introduction to the Australian Legal System. It provides a clear grounding in the western and indigenous legal 【traditions】, as well as the history of Australian law and legal institutions. There is a special emphasis on legal method which forms the 【basis】 of legal understanding. In particular, the text 【analyses】 and explains legal method- the following and distinguishing of precedent, statutory interpretation and the identification of ratio, which prepares students for their legal study. Numerous quality exercises prepare the way for legal thinking in students, for example,"Part 3: Legal Method" contains many examples and exercises to 【encourage】 understanding.

501.Zebra Stripes. 斑马条纹

How did the zebra get its stripes? One theory holds that stripes help confuse predators. But stripes might be 【primarily】 to protect zebras from ferocious... insects. That's 【according】 to a study in the Journal of Experimental Biology. Horseflies are abundant in Africa. They deliver painful bites that spread disease and distract animals from grazing. The flies use polarised light hitting water as a guide to places to mate and lay eggs. And they read such light hitting dark mammal hides as a sign of a blood meal. Zebra embryos start out dark and develop their white stripes before birth. Could the stripes confuse flies? The researchers went to a farm infested with horseflies, where they set up models of black and white stripes of varying angles and widths, thus changing the 【direction】 of the reflected polarised light. They tracked how the patterns affected the flies' interest. They then tested models of horses coloured black, brown, white or 【zebra-striped】. And again tracked the effect on flies. Turns out that the black and white stripes on a zebra are optimal for 【avoiding】 a horsefly's 【attention】. Meaning that zebras may have evolved stripes to ward off disease- carrying insects, and to dine in peace.

502.Bamboo. 竹子

Bamboo is a favoured plant among architects and designers because of its incredible strength and durability. One Colombian architect 【refers】 to it as nature's steel, but in many respects it is even better than steel: it is lighter and more flexible, and these 【qualities】 make it the ideal building material in areas that suffer earthquakes and severe weather patterns. Construction workers in places such as Hong Kong rely on bamboo scaffolding whatever the 【height】 of the tower block they may be working on: over a billion people around the world live in a home that is made of bamboo; and China 【has cultivated】 the plant for thousands of years. The only drawback to this remarkable product is the cost of transporting it. So for those 【who】 live in cooler regions of the world, the enormous advantages of this natural building material are less accessible.

503.Wetland Plant. 湿地植物

Experts have waited a considerable amount of time for this much- needed book. Now we have a new and very thorough survey of wetland plant species. The content is extensive and totally up- to- date and as reference 【material】, it represents extremely good value. In addition to the editors, there are 3 S well- chosen contributors who have put in a tremendous amount of work to 【assist】 the reader with maps and indexes, and colourful photographs. The plant descriptions are straightforward, yet scholarly, and flicking through the pages, 【you can sense】 the writers' passion for the subject. Each of the eight sections has an overview, 【highlighting】 current concerns and future conservation plans. Despite a few gaps and the occasional unsatisfactory illustration, this handbook will remind botanists and specialists of the importance of protecting the country's plant life. 【Every】 person interested in the topic, whether a student or a hardened expert, will find it indispensable.

504.Rodents. 啮齿动物

Rodents are the workhorses of biomedical labs. So it's important to know if they're 【stressed】 out, which could affect results. Now we know that lab rodents may be regularly exposed to a big stressor: men. Researchers noticed that mice showed a lower pain 【response】- a sign of stress- when a human was present. So they put mice and rats into clear cubicles, where their faces were visible, and 【injected】 them with an irritant. The rodents expressed pain through grimacing when no humans were nearby. But when confronted with a male researcher, or even just his 【odoriferous】 T- shirt, the animals grimaced less. Female observers did not get the same rodent 【reaction】. Turns out that smelling a human male made rodents produce higher levels of a stress hormone and increase their body 【temperature】. That stress response also blunted their sensitivity to pain. The study is in the journal Nature Methods. Researchers may have to come up with ways to ward off the stress effects of male researchers. Because to a rodent, men smell like hell.

505.Microbe. 微生物

You've probably noticed that 【synthetic】 t-shirts stink more after a workout, compared to cotton. But hey- it's not the 【fabric's】 fault. It's the microbes that hang out on synthetics, that create that 【characteristic】 stench. That's 【according】 to a study in the journal Applied and Environmental Microbiology. Twenty- six volunteers- half men, half women- worked out on spinning bikes for an hour. And they did so outfitted with shirts of cotton, 【polyester】, or a cotton/ synthetic blend. Then researchers stuffed the sweaty shirts into plastic bags. The next day, a trained panel sniffed them, rating their funk. Unlucky job. Because yes- the polyester shirts were indeed more musty, sour, and ammonia- like than the cotton. DNA analysis revealed that Micrococcus 【bacteria】 were to blame. They aren't actually all that common in the armpit itself. And they don't flock to cotton. But researchers say they thrive on the open- air lattice of synthetic fibres- where they sit chomping on the long- chain fatty acids in our sweat, turning them into shorter, stinkier molecules. These findings might just explain one of the most vexing questions of adolescence: why do stinky shirts smell so unpleasantly different from the body odour in the armpits themselves? Could be because your favourite shirt has a microbiome of its own.

506.Legendary Scientists. 传奇科学家

Einstein, Newton and many other legendary scientists did groundbreaking work in their 20 s. But if your hair has gone grey and no Nobel seems likely, don't fret just yet. Because the age at which 【Nobel-winning】 work gets done has been going up. So says a study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Researchers 【analyzed】 525 science Nobel Prize- winners from 1901 to 2008. In the small sample before 1905, about 【two-thirds】 of Nobel winners did their major work before age 40. But by 2000 most laureates did their cited work after age 40. The entire field of quantum mechanics was predominantly a young man's game- which meant that as late as 1934, more than three- quarters of physics prizes were for work done by people under 40. But the more mature researchers have steadily 【increased】 their catch since then. The study authors note that a shift from theoretical to experimental work can account for some of the age change. It also takes longer to educate and train new contributors to now- mature fields. So keep plugging. Unlike the youthful Archimedes, your"eureka" moment may come in a bathtub with safety bars.

507.Pharaoh's Mummy. 法老木乃伊

You've probably heard the 【expression】"a heart attack on a plate." Maybe it's fettuccini alfredo. Or maybe it's a bacon cheeseburger, covered in batter and deep fried to artery- clogging perfection. Either way, it's clear that our modern diet is not always the most cardio- friendly. But that doesn't mean that heart disease is a recent invention. Because a report in the Journal of the American Medical Association reveals that some Egyptian mummies show signs of atherosclerosis, 【hardening】 of the arteries. Previous examination of a pharaoh's mummy in the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities in Cairo showed that he'd suffered from atherosclerosis. Intrigued by this observation, 【scientists】 from the University of California, Irvine, got to wondering whether damaged arteries were common among ancient Egyptians. So they collected 20 mummies from the museum basement and from various displays, and 【subjected】 them to whole- body CT scans to look at their insides. Sixteen mummies still had identifiable hearts or arteries. And nine of them showed hardening of those arteries. Although no one knows what those mummies were eating, it's safe to say they never 【encountered】 a corn dog. Too many of those things will lead you to an early tomb.

508.Below-ground Organisms. 地下生物

"If you want to find unique 【diversity】 and if you want to find a wide range of 【different】 below- ground organisms, you don't have to travel around the world. You can walk across Central Park." That statement comes from Noah Fierer, an ecology and evolutionary biology professor at the University of Colorado, Boulder. He's also a 【coauthor】 of a study that uncovered the surprisingly large diversity of subterranean microbial life at the 843- acre green rectangle in the heart of Manhattan. The research is in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Investigators looked at 596 【separate】 soil samples from the park and found thousands of different types of microbes. They also compared those 【microbes】 with those living in 52 other soil samples taken from all around the planet. The park had organisms that also exist in deserts, frozen tundra, forests, 【rainforests】 and prairies. Antarctica was the only area that had microbes that did not overlap with those found in Central Park. And only a small percentage of the park's microbes were found to be already listed in databases. The variety of microbes probably reflects a diversity of soil conditions within the park. Seems that New York is a melting pot for people above the surface. And for microbes beneath it.

509.Voter. 选民

Researchers have 【discovered】 that improving voter turnout tends to result in better 【decision-making】- at least amongst fish. A recent study of 【stickleback】 found that they select a leader by consensus and, the more fish in the pool, the more likely they'll make a good choice. In the experiment, a school of fish was presented with two mock 【candidates】 for leader. One of the fake fish swam left, the other right. The pack of real fish was then allowed to decide which leader to follow. 【According】 to the study, which was published recently in the journal Current Biology, the stickleback tended to follow the candidate that looked the healthiest. Larger or fatter fish, for example, were usually chosen over smaller fish. Fish with spots- often a telltale sign of disease- 【generally】 lost out to a non-spotty adversary. The fish also seemed to have a preference for a more richly coloured candidate, though the researchers say they have yet to determine why. Maybe his 【environmental】 record won them over?

510.Science Writing. 科学写作

At the World Conference of Science Journalists last week in London, outgoing Scientific American Editor in Chief John Rennie talked to writers about the future of what they do, remarks that also pertain to this podcast: The question then is, how could science writing for the public possibly be better? I think there are a couple of different ideas. One of them is, maybe there should just be less of it. And because I would like to leave this room unlynched, let me amend that to say that at least there should be less of some of it. If our job is, ultimately as we see it, to try to inform the public better about science and technology, I for one think that we could all do with a lot fewer of the"what causes/ cures cancer this week" story. I think that in fact is directly related, that kind of story is really related to a different problem, which is that we have a model of 【following】 what defines science news as that 95 percent of the time it is"【interesting】 paper that appears in prestigious journal this week." That constitutes science news. Except that we're all smart enough to know that that has absolutely nothing to do with how science works. That has to do with how publishing works. That's what did they put into press this week. Science actually doesn't change when one, new important paper comes out. We all know that. The reality of science is it takes time for science to play itself out. When interesting new results come in, they're tested and they're confirmed and people rework them. One paper can be the landmark that starts to affect some of that, but the reality is the actual change in the science follows that often by a considerable amount of time. Sometimes long after we've actually written the big headlines about the exciting, dramatic, 【revolutionary】 change of whatever has come about because of 【something】. And I think that's something that I don't have a 【particular】 prescription on all of this. But I really think this comes down to why it is that we have a 【responsibility】 as editors to try to rethink what counts as science news.

511.Capsaicin. 辣椒素

Here's a possible blood 【pressure】 remedy. But it's only for those who can stand the heat. It's capsaicin, the"active ingredient" in peppers like habaneros that should probably be sold by prescription only. While lips burn and eyes water, blood vessels 【actually】 relax, thanks to increased 【production】 of the signalling molecule nitric oxide. In rodents, anyway. For seven months, 【researchers】 in China fed a steady diet of capsaicin to rats bred to be hypertensive. Long- term consumption of the chemical 【substantially】 lowered the rats' blood pressure. The results appear in the August issue of the journal Cell Metabolism. Previous research found mixed results with capsaicin, but those studies only looked at 【short-term】 effects. Human trials are needed, but there's already a clue. Some 20 percent of people in northeastern China have high blood pressure. But the southwest- where hot peppers are a dietary staple- has a much lower incidence, half in some places. Human studies could also confirm whether the habanero, as legend has it, can cause hearing loss. Allegedly so that diners don't have to listen to their own screams.

512.Social Influence. 社会影响

If you want to guess how many jelly beans are in a jar, you should ask your friends. Then average their answers. Because a group guess is often more accurate than that of any one individual. Just don't let them peek at each other's responses. Because a new study shows that social influence can sway people's 【estimate】 and render the crowd 【incorrect】. The work appears in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Crowd wisdom is actually a statistical phenomenon. Gather enough estimates and the wild guesses cancel each other out, bringing you closer to the answer. But psychology and statistics don't 【mix】. And knowing what your peers think doesn't make you any smarter. European scientists asked volunteers to estimate statistics like the population density of Switzerland. Each person got five guesses. Some were shown their peers' answers and others weren't. Turns out that seeing others' estimates led to a lot of second guessing, which 【narrowed】 the range of the group's responses and pointed them in the wrong direction. Even 【worse】, knowing that others said the same thing made everyone more confident they were right. So there is wisdom in numbers- as long as those numbers keep quiet til they're counted.

513.Active Brain. 活跃大脑

Keeping the brain active and engaged appears to combat the cognitive decline associated with getting older. Now a study has found a new, but related, factor in maintaining a sharp mind- the space in which we live. Researchers recruited almost 1, 300 senior citizens, none of whom showed any signs of clinical dementia at the start of the study. The participants had their cognitive function tested annually for up to eight years. And they also described their living space. For example, maybe they mostly hung around their bedroom. Perhaps they spent time in the yard. Or frequently travelled. By the end of the study, 180 people had Alzheimers. And those whose 【life-space】 narrowed in on their immediate home were almost twice as likely to develop the 【condition】 as those who ventured out. The homebound folks also had an 【increased】 risk of other cognitive impairments and a faster rate of cognitive decline. The research was published in the American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry. The study's lead investigator, Bryan James of the Rush University Medical Centre in Chicago, 【suggests】 that,"Perhaps life space is an indicator of how much we are 【actively】 engaging and challenging our cognitive 【abilities】."

514.Voting. 投票

When it comes to 【elections】, sometimes we vote with our heads and sometimes with our hearts. But scientists at 【Stanford】 say we might also be voting with our pompoms. Because they've found that our behaviour at the polls is influenced by the results of local 【sporting】 events, work published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Humans are emotional 【creatures】. And our strong feelings about one thing can spread to another. So the Stanford scientists wondered whether events that are unrelated to government performance might sway the way people feel about their elected officials. And what could be less 【relevant】 to the workings in Washington or your state capital than college football? The researchers looked at the election results from 20 years' worth of 【presidential】, senatorial and gubernatorial races. And they found that a 【home-team】 win before the election gave the incumbent a boost of almost two percentage points. The more beloved the team, the bigger the bounce. And it's not just football. In a separate survey, the scientists found that NCAA college basketball results affected presidential approval ratings. So next election day, you might think about practising a little separation of stadium and state.

515.Cell Template. 细胞模板

One of the great promises of stem- cell biology is to use a patient's own cells as a template to build a real, working organ or tissue in the lab. One prime example: a 【treatment】 for diabetes by turning stem cells into working pancreatic beta cells, which release insulin."The existing beta cells that our lab and others had created were 90 percent of the way there. But 90 percent still means not functional." Ron Evans, a molecular 【biologist】 at the Salk Institute. Evans compares the stem- cell- derived beta cells they first made to a darkened room."If you walk into that room, there may be everything in it that you need to be a complete room, with furniture and chairs and everything else. But it's dark. And the key is: what do you need to turn on the light?" That light switch, Evans discovered, is a gene- called oestrogen- related receptor gamma. Flip it on, and it 【activates】 a genetic circuit that ramps up mitochondria production, powers up the cell, and endows the almost- functional beta cells with the ability to sense glucose and release insulin in 【response】. Evans's team recently used that trick to transform stem cells into beta cells that worked just like they would in a healthy pancreas. When they transplanted those cells into mice with a mouse version of diabetes, blood glucose fell to normal levels in half the rodents. The results are in the journal Cell Metabolism. Next, Evans says he'll replicate the test in diabetic primates."Primates get diabetes in a fashion that's very similar to people. So if it works in a primate, very high probability that it's going to work in people." If it does, we might someday replace a shot of insulin with a shot of cells.

516.Bird Food. 鸟类食物

If you've ever been to an all- you- can- eat buffet, you know how 【important】 it is to 【carefully】 weigh your options. You don't want to fill up on salad when so many 【calorie-laden】 delights await. It seems some birds also weigh their mealtime choices- literally. A study finds that Mexican Jays pick up and shake peanuts to assess their relative heft before choosing one. That report is served up in the Journal of Ornithology. Foods that hide their edible bits on the inside present a challenge to hungry diners. How can you tell which fruits are ripe or which shells harbour the biggest nuts? We humans knock on melons or squeeze avocados. But how do other species select the highest quality snacks? To find out how the jays do it, researchers fiddled with their feed. First they doctored peanuts so that some contained three nuts while others had none. When they offered these pods to some jays, the birds turned their beaks up at the empty shells and instead chose those that were full. And when the jays were allowed to choose between normal peanuts and those that weighed just one gramme more, because the researchers had stuffed them with clay, the birds again went for the heavier meal. Videos 【revealed】 that the jays shake the nuts before 【selecting】 one, which apparently lets them gauge the nut's mass and perhaps also listen for the rattle of a well- packed shell. Pretty clever for a bird brain.

517.Odorous House Ant. 臭家蚁

A common response to seeing an ant inside your house is to stomp on it. But if you crush a member of the ant species Tapinoma sessile, you might catch a whiff of a strange smell- a smell that reminds some people of blue cheese, rancid butter or rotten coconut. In fact, the smell is so noticeable that the insect's common name is the"odorous house ant." And many people call it the coconut ant. In an effort to figure out why people have these reactions, 【researchers】 enlisted 【visitors】 at an event called the North Carolina BugFest. One- hundred- forty- three volunteers smelled smushed ants and were asked to identify the scent from four choices: blue cheese, rancid butter, rotten coconut or just other. Although Web sites overwhelmingly call the smell rotten coconut, almost 40 percent of the human judges picked blue cheese and about 25 percent picked rotten coconut. More than 30 percent went with the choice of other. The scientists then analysed the chemicals 【responsible】 for the ant odour, as well as the smelly chemicals in blue cheese, fresh coconut and coconut buried underground for three days. It turns out that the chemistry of the ants' scent is indeed similar to that of blue cheese and rotten coconut. But not to fresh coconut. And the researchers note that the Penicillium 【microbes】 that turn coconut oil rancid are also 【involved】 in the production of blue cheese. The study is in the journal American Entomologist. The researchers also noted that the most common write- in candidate as a description for the ants' aroma was"cleaning spray." And one little girl told them that the ants"smelled exactly like her doctor."

518.Ernest. 欧内斯特

Ernest Shackleton was a British explorer of the South Pole who is best remembered for leading his crew to safety after the failed expedition of the Endurance( 1914– 16). Shackleton had been a junior officer on Robert Falcon Scott's discovery 【expedition】( 1902- 03), and his travels with the Nimrod( 1907- 09) had taken him closer to the South Pole than anyone before. After Roald Amundsen reached the Pole in 1911, Shackleton and a crew of 28 men set out in his ship Endurance in 1914, in the 【hope】 of being the first to cross the polar continent. The ship was frozen in ice, then crushed, and Shackleton and his men set out in lifeboats after nearly a year and a half on the ice. Shackleton, known as"The Boss," took five men and sailed 800 miles in an open boat from Elephant Island to the island of South Georgia, then went back and 【saved】 the rest of his crew, all of whom survived. Almost two years after starting out, they reached safety in South America in September 1916. In spite of his heroics, Shackleton had a hard time back in England with finances and alcohol. He 【eventually】 managed to get financing for another voyage to Antarctica in 1921, but he had a fatal heart attack at South Georgia Island and 【never】 made it.

519.Great Barrier Reef. 大堡礁

One of Australia's most remarkable natural gifts, the Great Barrier Reef is blessed with the breathtaking beauty of the world's largest coral reef. The reef contains an 【abundance】 of marine life and comprises of over 3000 individual reef systems and coral cays and literally hundreds of 【picturesque】 tropical islands with some of the world's most beautiful sun- soaked, golden beaches. Because of its natural beauty, the Great Barrier Reef has become one of the world's most 【sought】- after tourist destinations. A visitor to the Great Barrier Reef can enjoy many 【experiences】 including snorkelling, scuba diving, aircraft or helicopter tours, bare boats( self- sail) glass- bottomed boat viewing, semi- submersibles and educational trips, cruise ship tours, whale watching and swimming with dolphins.

520.Sociology. 社会学

Sociology is, in very basic terms, the study of human societies. In this respect, it is usually 【classed】 as one of the social sciences( along with subjects like psychology) and was 【established】 as a subject in the late 18 th century( through the work of people like the French writer Auguste Comte). However, the subject has only really gained 【acceptance】 as an academic subject in the 20 th century through the work of writers such as Emile Durkheim, Max Weber and Talcott Parsons( names that will be visited throughout this course). One name that you may have heard of- Karl Marx( the founder of modern Communism)- has probably done more to stimulate people' s interest in the subject than anyone else, even though he lived and wrote( 1818- 1884) in a period before sociology became fully established as an academic discipline. Sociology, therefore, has a reasonably long history of development( 150- 200 years), 【although】 in Britain it has only been in the last 30- 40 years that sociology as an examined subject in the education system has achieved a level of importance equivalent to, or above, most of the other subjects it is possible to study.

521.Jack Lewis. 杰克·刘易斯

C. S. Lewis, or Jack Lewis, as he preferred to be called, was born in Belfast, Ireland( now Northern Ireland) on November 29, 1898. He was the second son of Albert Lewis, a lawyer, and Flora Hamilton Lewis. His older brother, Warren Hamilton Lewis, who was known as Warnie, had been born three years 【earlier】 in 1895. Lewis's early childhood was relatively happy and carefree. In those days Northern Ireland was not yet 【plagued】 by bitter civil strife, and the Lewises were comfortably off. The family home, called Little Lea, was a large, gabled house with dark, narrow passages and an overgrown garden, which Warnie and Jack played in and 【explored】 together. There was also a library that was crammed with books- two of Jack's favourites were Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson and The Secret Garden by Frances Hodgson Burnett. This somewhat idyllic boyhood came to an end for Lewis when his mother became ill and died of cancer in 1908. Barely a month after her death the two boys were sent away from home to go to boarding school in England. Lewis hated the school, with its strict rules and hard, 【unsympathetic】 headmaster, and he missed Belfast terribly. Fortunately for him, the school closed in 1910, and he was able to return to Ireland. After a year, however, he was sent back to England to study. This time, the 【experience】 proved to be mostly positive. As a teenager, Lewis learned to love poetry, especially the works of Virgil and Homer. He also 【developed】 an interest in modern languages, mastering French, German, and Italian.

522.Salmon. 鲑鱼

Each fall, thousands of coho salmon flock to 【Northwest】 rivers to spawn. But many never get the chance, especially near big cities like Seattle."And in some of these urban areas, up to 90 percent of the females were dying before they spawned, which is not a good thing for a population long term." Julann Spromberg, a toxicologist affiliated with the Northwest Fisheries Science Centre. Researchers suspected these deaths were partly a matter of bad timing. The fish often reach streams during the first showers of the rainy season, which flush chemicals from roads and parking lots into the water. Now, Spromberg and her colleagues have produced the first direct evidence that this runoff kills coho salmon. Their study is in the Journal of Applied Ecology. The researchers found that fish exposed to storm water from Seattle- area highways quickly grew sick and died. Surprisingly, though, the salmon did not seem to mind taking a dip in a cocktail of common road pollutants, including 【hydrocarbons】 and metals. That detail suggests the killer ingredient in runoff may be a different kind of chemical or a lethal combination of several 【compounds】."There's a whole lot of stuff in here that we haven't been able to measure or don't have the capabilities of 【measuring】 at this point." However, Spromberg says there's a way to help the fish even before scientists hunt down the culprit. Her team also found that 【filtering】 runoff through just a few feet of soil made storm water safe for salmon. Cities can 【implement】 this simple form of clean water technology by building more systems, including roadside rain gardens, to collect runoff from paved areas and pass it through soil before it enters urban waterways. Literally a quick and dirty solution.

523.Crustaceans' Pain. 甲壳类动物的痛感

The last time you 【splurged】 on a live lobster for dinner, you might not have given any thought to how much the little guy was going to suffer as he boiled to death. Until recently many researchers 【believed】 the crustacean nervous system too primitive to process pain. But scientists at Queen's University in Belfast now think that crustaceans may be more sensitive to pain than 【previously】 thought. The researchers used crabs as their test animals. And they found that crabs that 【experienced】 an electric shock when they hid under a safe, dark rock would 【eventually】 learn to avoid the hiding place. And that avoidance is key: the animals' ability to remember the unpleasant shock and avoid it is consistent with the ability to feel and remember pain. If the behaviour was merely a reflex, the critters would continue to visit the shelter. The study is in the Journal of Experimental Biology."Also see Nicola Stead, Painful Feelings in Crabs" The situation is likely the same with lobsters. So before you break out the bibs and melted butter, it might be nice to put your future dinner on a little anaesthetic ice.

524.Bentham. 边沁

By the 1820 s Bentham had become a well- known figure, both in Britain and in other parts of the world. His ideas were to 【influence】 the reforms of public administration made during the nineteenth century, and his writings are still at the centre of academic debate, especially regarding social policy, legal positivism, and welfare economics. Bentham died on 6 June 1832, a day before the first Reform Act was given Royal Assent. As per the 【directions】 in his will, Bentham's body was dissected by his friend, the surgeon Thomas Southwood Smith, and his skeleton preserved as the Auto- Icon. Research into Bentham's thought and life continues today at UCL's Bentham Project, set up in the early 1960 s with the aim 【of】 producing the first scholarly edition of his works and correspondence. This edition is projected to 【run】 to some eighty volumes. Members of the public are invited to assist in this massive editorial task by helping to transcribe Bentham's manuscripts via Transcribe Bentham.

525.Public Archaeology. 公共考古学

The aim of this book is to give the reader an overview of study and practise in the field of public archaeology. It offers a series of snapshots of important ideas and areas of work brought together as an introduction, 【albeit】 an inevitably brief and incomplete one, to one of the most challenging and rewarding parts of the wider archaeological discipline. Read the book from cover to cover and you will have a good working understanding 【of】 public archaeology 【as】 a complicated, rich and diverse field, 【as well as】 knowledge of some of the most significant and iconic examples of public archaeology in action. 【Dip】 into a specific chapter and you will find a concise and insightful introduction to one aspect of public archaeology with case studies and a list of readings to develop your understanding. 【However】 you use this book I am confident that you will emerge with a better understanding of what public archaeology is, why it matters and what you can do about it. First, it is necessary and useful, drawing on the quotes above, to ask what we mean by public archaeology, and to examine some of the different ways it has been defined.

526.UK drivers. 英国司机

In the UK, it is recommended that drivers should turn off their car engines when they expect to be stationary for more than 1 minute. To encourage drivers to turn off their 【engines】 while waiting at rail crossings, the Kent City Council placed a permanent sign at the crossing asking drivers to"please switch off your engine when barriers are down to help improve air quality." 【On average】, drivers had to wait between 2 and 3 minutes to cross after the barrier had gone down. However, the sign didn't seem to be convincing 【the majority of】 drivers to switch off their engines."Although some research suggests that signs alone can change behaviour, the message on this sign was designed simply to be an informational request and was not guided by any particular behavioural theory," the researchers explain. So the 【research】 team, led by Rose Mellady of the University of East Anglia, designed an intervention study.

527.Learning from History. 从历史中学习

The prospect of learning something from history is what makes sociologists tick. It is through 【developing】 a systematic understanding of the forces which shape our lives that we 【can】 exercise control over them. The founding thinkers of sociology, who 【came】 to prominence during the development of what we are pleased to call modernity, thought so. It Is the intimate relationship between the development of sociology and the development of modernity that the course begins with. This relationship is an intimate one, because it is 【only】 with the social change instituted in the development of the modern world that a discipline such as sociology and social science in general could either exist or have anything to study.

528.Pop Art. 波普艺术

Emerging in the mid 1950 s in Britain and late 1950 s in America, pop art reached its peak in the 1960 s. It began as a revolt 【against】 the dominant approaches to art and culture and traditional views on what art 【should be】. Young artists felt that what they were taught at art school and what they saw in museums did not have anything 【to do with】 their lives or the things they saw around them every day. Instead they 【turned to】 sources such as Hollywood movies, advertising, product packaging, pop music and comic books for their imagery.

529.Avid Readers. 狂热读者

Victorians were avid readers. Just as we bury our faces in our mobile devices on the morning commute, 【so too】 did Victorians with the latest penny fiction. Towards the latter half of the 19th century, gas and electric lighting also 【meant that】 reading after dark didn't have to be by candlelight or messy oil lamps. Perhaps the best known serialised novels were the"Penny Dreadfuls". 【Costing】 just one old penny, they focused on the exploits of detectives, criminals, or supernatural entities. The price of new books- often only available as a set of three- was out of reach for most working- class people, so they borrowed from circulating libraries 【such as】 Mudie's( founded 1842), which dispatched books all over Britain for a modest subscription fee. For the wealthier classes who 【could afford】 first editions, reading from their own collection would be an everyday occurrence.

530.Modern Technology. 现代技术

Modern technology has enhanced the study of language by making its sounds observable in greater detail and with greater accuracy than ever before, but the thoughts associated with those sounds remain problematic. Currently developing 【techniques】 of brain imaging are allowing us to observe for the first- time which parts of the brain are active in different circumstances. They do not, however, show experiences themselves, which may always remain 【hidden】 from public observation. There is a sense in which each of us knows what we are thinking, 【although】 we may not always have a good way of verbalising it. But the only way we can know what someone else is thinking is through what that person says, or through some other overt action, a 【facial】 expression or gesture, perhaps from which that person's thoughts may be inferred, or from imagining what we ourselves would be thinking 【in】 similar circumstances.

531.Freud's Theory. 弗洛伊德理论

Freud's psychosexual theory, leaving questions about its validity, is necessary to be tested scientifically. 【However】, he never did experiments. Another concern is that the theory is based on case studies versus research. Some have issues with Freud's theory being focused more on male psychosexual development, 【offering】 very little insight into females. It also refers to homosexual preferences as a deviation of normal psychosexual development, though many psychologists today feel that sexual orientation is more biological in nature and Freud's theory is 【one-sided】.

532.Tiny Creatures. 微小生物

Think of the 【weirdest】 creatures you've ever seen in a sci- fi film. Now think of this: there are far stranger, albeit smaller, critters living in your own home. And Rob Dunn at North Carolina State University wants you to go on safari to find them. Research has been done on the 【diversity】 of bacteria, fungi and other organisms that live on our skin, in our guts, even in our belly buttons. But there are other entire ecosystems that surround us. And scientists want to understand how they differ based on how and where we live. What's the tiny life like on a door frame in Brooklyn compared with that in Des Moines? Or how do fridge 【microbes】 of an urban singleton stack up with those of a suburban family? The research team seeks ten volunteers from each state, five urban and five rural. Each volunteer will get a kit of vials and swabs, along with instructions about where and how to swipe- such as door frames, couch cushions, refrigerators, 【even】 yourself. The samples will be 【analysed】, to uncover the secrets of our 【microscopic】 companions. To find out more, go to robdunnlab. com.

533.Subsidies. 补贴

Governments also frequently subsidise local industries to help them compete in the global market. Subsidies come 【in the form of】 tax credits or direct payments. The most commonly used are farm subsidies. That allows producers to lower the price of local goods and services. This 【makes】 the products cheaper 【even】 when shipped overseas. Subsidies work even better than tariffs. This method works best for countries that rely mainly on exports. 【But】 sometimes subsidies can have the opposite effect. The Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 allowed the government to pay farmers 【not】 to grow crops or livestock, which let their fields rest and regain nutrients. It helped the agriculture industry but raised food costs during the Depression.

534.Snack Choices. 零食选择

Jennifer Harris, a researcher at the University of Connecticut's Rudd Centre for Food Policy & Obesity, has studied the impact of food advertising on children's eating 【behaviours】. In one key experiment, children aged 7 to 11 watched a cartoon interspersed with either food or non-food advertisements. Afterward, they were given a bowl of cheddar cheese crackers to snack 【on】. The results showed that children exposed to food ads consumed 45% more snacks than those who saw non-food ads. This study suggests that food advertising can significantly increase snack 【consumption】 among children, potentially contributing to unhealthy eating habits and obesity. Food ads, often designed with colourful packaging and appealing characters, trigger cravings in children, making them more likely to choose unhealthy, calorie- dense snacks. These advertisements create emotional associations between eating the product and feelings of enjoyment or fun, further encouraging children to 【indulge】. The findings highlight the need for stricter regulations on food advertising targeting children. By reducing exposure to these ads, it may be possible to mitigate their influence and promote healthier eating 【habits】. Harris's research underscores the importance of protecting children from marketing practises that could lead to long- term health issues, such as obesity.

535.Gamification. 游戏化

Gamification refers to the integration of game- like elements into non- game environments, particularly in the workplace, to drive engagement and 【motivation】. It involves using mechanics such as points, badges, leaderboards, and challenges to make tasks more engaging, rewarding, and fun. The primary goal of gamification is to inspire employees to perform better, work more collaboratively, and meet their objectives while feeling 【acknowledged】 for their efforts. To be effective, gamification needs to be thoughtfully 【implemented】. It should align with company goals and be tailored to the needs of employees. Overuse or poorly designed gamification systems can backfire, leading to stress or disengagement. Successful gamification strategies tap into intrinsic motivation, offering employees meaningful rewards, fostering a sense of achievement, and encouraging healthy 【competition】. The key is to ensure the game elements enhance the workplace experience rather than distract from it. Kevin Werbach, a professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, is a leading expert on gamification. Through his research and teaching, Werbach has explored how businesses can apply these game mechanics to increase employee motivation and 【performance】.

536.Circular time. 循环时间

Each of us is born into and raised in a particular"time world"-- an environment with its own 【rhythm】 to which we entrain ourselves. Certain cultures have related to time as a 【cyclical】 phenomenon, in which there is no pressure or future anxiety. The whole of existence goes around: the cycle of the seasons, of planting and harvesting, the daily return of the sun, of birth and death. In circular time there is no pressing need to 【achieve】 and create newness, or to insatiably produce more than is needed to simply survive. Additionally, there is no fear of death. Such societies have successfully integrated the past and future into a peaceful sense of the 【present】. They also honoured the wisdom of elders who held the knowledge of the 【past】-- upon which the future was clearly linked.

537.Mozart effect. 莫扎特效应

Researchers have debunked the much- publicised idea, known as the Mozart effect, that listening to classical music improves children's ability to reason about spatial relations and other nonverbal tasks. Learning to play a musical instrument or to sing, 【however】, may indeed give youngsters an intellectual edge over their peers, a new study 【suggests】. Six- year- olds who took weekly piano or singing lessons throughout the school year 【exhibited】 an average IQ increase of 7. 0 points, says psychologist E. Glenn Schellenberg of the University of Toronto at Mississauga. Other 6- year- olds who 【either】 took weekly drama lessons or received no extracurricular lessons displayed an average IQ rise of 4. 3 points, Schellenberg reports in the August Psychological Science.

538.Ice Tongue. 冰舌

Ice tongue is a glacial formation created by an ice stream flowing faster than the surrounding 【ice】. As the glacier moves toward the sea or a body of water, it extends outward, forming a large, finger- like projection of ice. This happens when the glacier's flow rate 【exceeds】 the surrounding ice, causing the ice to break off and form an"ice tongue." Over time, sections of the ice tongue may 【calve】, creating icebergs and further shaping its structure. One well- known example is the Erebus Ice Tongue, located on the 【coast】 of Antarctica near Mount Erebus. This ice tongue extends from the Ross Ice Shelf and is influenced by both the flow of the glacier and the nearby volcanic activity of Mount Erebus. The Erebus Ice Tongue is a significant feature in glaciology because it highlights the interaction between glacial dynamics and geothermal heat from the volcano. The formation and stability of ice tongues like Erebus are important for understanding sea- level 【rise】, as changes in the ice tongue's size or structure can affect the flow of ice into the ocean. Studying these features helps scientists predict how Antarctica's glaciers will respond to climate change and their potential contribution to rising sea levels.

539.Bourdieu’s theory. 布迪厄理论

In the framework of Bourdieu's theory, human society operates through a complex system of classifications, where social groups are defined not only by their material resources but also by their cultural capital- forms of knowledge, taste, and practise that are valued by dominant social structures. These patterns of thought shape how individuals view themselves and others, perpetuating a hierarchy of power and 【status】. The dominant classes, in particular, maintain their status by controlling these classifications, defining what is considered"legitimate" or"refined" knowledge, and thus marginalising other ways of thinking and being. Bourdieu's concept of"habitus" describes how these patterns of thought become internalised in individuals, guiding their actions and perceptions in ways that reinforce the existing social 【system】. At the same time, the process of classification is not fixed but subject to contestation. Over time, the dominance of elite groups can be challenged, leading to shifts in the status of certain forms of knowledge or cultural practises. In this sense, Bourdieu suggests that the social structure is not merely a reflection of economic power, but also a reflection of the intellectual and cultural systems that 【preserve】 it. The task, therefore, is to recognise how these classifications function to legitimise power and to question the hierarchical systems that serve to 【reduce】 the status of those on the margins.

540.King Arthur. 亚瑟王

Little is known about the figure that inspired the story of King Arthur. While Arthurian legends have been a part of Western literature for centuries, the historical reality of King Arthur remains shrouded in 【obscurity】. The earliest references to a figure resembling Arthur come from various sources, including Welsh, Latin, and later, mediaeval English texts. However, concrete evidence linking Arthur to a specific historical figure is 【lacking】. One of the key figures associated with the Arthurian legend is the 6 th- century Welsh bard Aweinrin( also known as Awenydd). While Aweinrin himself is an elusive historical figure, his works, particularly his poetry, suggest that he may have played a role in shaping the mythic image of Arthur. Aweinrin's poems are filled with references to heroic warriors and 【battles】, which may have been inspired by real historical events or figures from the tumultuous period of post- Roman Britain. In the context of Arthur, Aweinrin's work might have contributed to the development of the legend of a warrior king who defends his people against invaders. Though Aweinrin's connection to Arthur is 【speculative】, some scholars believe that elements of his poetry could have been woven into later tales of the Arthurian cycle. Whether or not Aweinrin directly inspired the stories of King Arthur, his legacy as a poet and historian of his time remains 【influential】 in understanding the origins of these enduring myths.

541.Lionfish. 狮子鱼

"Until now, few sightings of the alien lionfish Pterois miles have been reported in the Mediterranean and it was 【questionable】 whether the species could invade this region like it has in the western Atlantic." Demetris Kletou, co-author of the paper said in a statement." But we've found that lionfish have recently 【increased】 in abundance, and within a year have colonised almost the entire south eastern coast of Cyprus, assisted by sea surface warming. Lionfish were originally found in the waters of the Pacific and lndian Oceans. They likely ended up in the Caribbean and Western Atlantic after 【being released】 from home aquariums. The invasion of the Mediterranean has different roots. The expansion of the Suez Canal has given lionfish even 【more access】 to the Mediterranean Sea and warming water temperatures have provided the 【perfect】 environment for the invasive species.
