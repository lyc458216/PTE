1.Arabic students. 阿拉伯学生  

Arab students will be able to sign up to study at a 【distance】 for the business courses in their own language. The Edinburgh Business School 【announced】 the project at a 【reception】 in Cairo on Saturday. It is hoped the course will improve links between the university and the Arab business world. A university spokeswoman said: The Arabic MBA will 【raise】 the profile of Heriot Watt University and the Edinburgh Business School among businesses in the Arabic-speaking world and will create a strong 【network】 of graduates in the 【region】. The first 【intake】 of students is expected later this year. Professor Keith Lumsden, director of Edinburgh Business School, said: Arabic is a major global language and the Arab world is a centre for business and industrial development. We are proud to work with Arab International Education to meet the demands of the region.

2.Mount Everest. 珠穆朗玛峰  

Called Chomolungma, goddess mother of the world, in Tibet and Sagarmatha, goddess of the sky, in Nepal. Mount Everest once went by the pedestrian name Peak XV among Westerners. That was before 【surveyors】 established that it was the highest mountain on Earth, a fact that cames something of a surprise, Peak XV had seemed lost in the crowd of other formidable Himalayan peaks, many of which gave the 【illusion】 of greater height.
In 1852 the Great Trigonometrically Survey of India measured Everest's elevation as 29,002 feet above sea level. This figure remained the officially 【accepted】 height for more than one hundred years. In 1955 it was adjusted by a mere 26 feet to 29,028.
The mountain received its official name in 1865 in honour of Sir George Everest, the British Surveyor General from 1830 to 1843 who had mapped the India subcontinent. He had some 【reservations】 about having his name bestowed on the peak, arguing that the mountain should retain its local appellation, the standard policy of geographical societies.
Before the Survey of India, a number of the other mountains ranked supreme in the eyes of the world. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the Andean peak Chimborazo was considered the highest. At a relatively unremarkable 20,561 feet. it is in fact nowhere near the highest, 【surpassed】 by about thirty other Andean peaks and several dozens in the Himalayas. In 1809, the Himalayan peak Dhaulagiri was declared the ultimate, only to be shunted aside in 1840 by Kanchenjunga , which today ranks third. Everest's status has been unrivalled for the last century and a half, but not without a few threats.

3.Richard Morris. 理查德·莫里斯  

Richard Morris, of the school of accounting at the University of NSW, which requires an entrance score in the top 5 percent of students, says attendance has been a problem since the late 1990s.
"Sometimes in the lectures we've only got about one-third of students 【enrolled】 attending," he said.
"It definitely is a problem. If you don't turn up to class you're missing out on the whole richness of the 【experience】: you don't think a whole lot, you don't 【engage】 in debates with other students, or with your teachers."
It is not all gloom, said Professor John Dearn, a Province-Chancellor at the University of Canberra, who said the Internet was 【transforming】 the way students access and use information.
"It is strange that despite all the evidence as to their ineffectiveness, 【traditional】 lecture seems to persist in our universities."

4.Foreign students' English standards. 留学生的英语水平  

Federal Education Minister Julie Bishop says she has seen no 【evidence】 that international students are graduating from Australian universities with poor English skills. Research by Monash University academic Bob Birrell has found a third of international students are graduating 【without】 a competent level of English. But Ms. Bishop says Australian universities only enrol international students once they have achieved international standards of language 【proficiency】."This has been an extraordinary attack by Professor Birrell on our universities," she said."International students must meet international 【benchmarks】 in the English language in order to get a place at a university in Australia, and they can't get into university without reaching that international standard."
University of Canberra vice-chancellor Roger Dean also says international students are required to sit an English test before being admitted to nearly all Australian universities."There are, of course, intercultural difficulties as well as language difficulties," he said."There are, of course, also many Australian students who don't speak such 【fantastically】 good English either.""So we're trying to push the standard even higher than a present, but it's a very useful one already."
Ms. Bishop says Australia's university system has high standards."I've seen no evidence to suggest that students are not able to complete their courses because they're failing in English yet they're being passed by the universities," she said."I've not seen any evidence to back that up."
"International education is one of our largest exports, it's our fourth largest export, and it's in the interest of our universities to maintain very high standards because their 【reputation】 is 【at stake】."

5.Plants & Animals band. 植物与动物乐队  

Plants and Animals are a Montreal-based indie rock 【trio】 that began playing together as kids. Touring 【arduously】 for about five years after their proper full-length debut in 2008, they pretty much made their records on the go until 2013. So the band's decision to be slow, deliberate, and thorough on their latest offering Waltzed In From The Rumbling, represents a major change of pace. Finally sleeping in there in own beds while recording, the band assembled the album over the course of nine seasons. It's a return to their origins, but it also pushes audaciously forward.
The 【aesthetic】 varies wildly and wonderfully from track to track, each song having its own hermetic seal but somehow still melding 【cohesively】 as a body of work. Jangling guitars, drums leaning toward the off-kilter swing of J Dilla, found sounds, a hint of shoegaze, and unorthodox instrumentation come together to keep the ear constantly 【engaged】 with a feeling of constant evolution. They found an antique guiro next to broken VCR and recorded both. They made an empty fridge sound like a timpani drum. They recorded gossip on a city bus. They brought in classical string flourishes. They sometimes left mistakes if they felt they were perfectly imperfect. It's truly DIY, but with a feel of big production value that makes the album soar.
Contemplative lyrics anchor the album through all the exploratory 【wandering】. The words are delivered melodically, belying their potency, but listening beyond the pretty aesthetic reveals piercing observations and an undeniable translation of feeling. The simplicity of the penetrating refrain on the three-part mini-opus"Je Voulais Te Dire" is a paragon of how the lyrics effortlessly cut through the instrumentation. Guitarist or vocalist Warren Spicer sings"It's only loving, but you want it bad." encompassing how we try to avoid and downplay our desire for love and affection, but ultimately search and long for it anyway.

6.Wolf. 狼  

From the wolf's perspective, this is clearly good news. But it also had beneficial effects on the ecology of the park, according to a study published in 2004 by William Ripple and Robert Beschta from Oregon State University. In their paper in BioScience, the two researchers showed that 【reintroducing】 the wolves was 【correlated】 with the increased growth of willow and cottonwood in the park. Why? Because grazing animals such as elk were 【avoiding】 sites from which they couldn't easily escape, the scientists 【claimed】. And as the woody plants and trees grew taller and thicker, beaver 【colonies】 expanded.

7.Roman Arena. 罗马竞技场  

The Romans glorified the 【bravery】 shown in the arena, but 【trivialised】 the events and degraded the participants. Mosaic pictures of executions and combats, 【graphically】 violent to our eyes, were displayed in the public rooms and even dining rooms in the homes of wealthy Romans. How can the viewer today possibly understand such images? Until fairly recently, modern authors writing about the arena minimised its significance and 【represented】 the institutionalised violence as a sideline to Roman history. The 【tendency】 was also to view the events through our own eyes and to see them as pitiful or horrifying, although to most Romans empathy with victims of the arena was inconceivable. In the past few decades, however, scholars have started to analyse the complex motivations for deadly public entertainments and for contradictory views of gladiators as despised, yet beloved hero- slaves.

8.Estee Lauder. 雅诗兰黛  

She transformed beauty into big business by cultivating classy sales methods and giving away samples.
Leonard Lauder, chief executive of the company his mother founded, says she always thought she"was growing a mice little business." And that it is. A little business that 【controls】 45 percent of the cosmetics market in U.S. department stores. A little business that sells in 118 countries and last year grew to be 3.6 billion big in sales. The Lauder family's shares are worth more than 6 billion.
But early on, there wasn't a burgeoning business; there weren't houses in New York. Palm Beach, Fla., or the south of France. It is said that at one point there was one person to answer the telephones who 【changed】 her voice to become the shipping or billing department as needed.
You more or less know the Estee Lauder story because it's a chapter from the book of American business folklore. In short, Josephine Esther Mentzer, daughter of immigrants, lived above her father's hardware store in Corona, a section of Queens in New York City. She started her 【enterprise】 by selling skin creams concocted by her uncle, a chemist, in beauty shops, beach clubs and resorts.
No doubt the potions were good, Estee Lauder was a quality fanatic, but the sales lady was better. Much better. And she simply outworked everyone else in the cosmetics industry. She 【stalked】 the bosses of New York City department stores until she got some counter space at Saks Fifth Avenue in 1948. And once in that space, she utilised a personal selling approach that proved as 【potent】 as the promise of her skin regimens and perfumes.

9.Wine and ale. 葡萄酒与麦芽酒  

By the Bronze Age, drinking 【vessels】 were being made of sheet metal, primarily bronze or gold. However, the peak of feasting, and in particular, of the' political' type of feast, came in the late Hallstatt period, about 600 to 450 BC, soon after the foundation of the Greek 【colony】 of Massalia at the mouth of the Rhine. From that date on, the blood of the grape began to make its way north and east along major river systems together with imported metal and ceramic drinking vessels from the Greek world.
The wine was thus added to the list of mood-altering beverages, such as mead and ale, available to establish social networks in Iron Age Europe. Attic pottery fragments found at hill forts such as Heuneburg in Germany and 【luxury】 goods such as the monumental 5th century Greek bronze krater, or wine-mixing vessel, found at Vix in Burgundy supply archaeological evidence of this interaction. Organic 【containers】 such as leather or wooden wine barrels may also have travelled north into Europe but have not survived It is unknown what goods were 【traded】 in return, but they may have included salted meat, hides, timber, amber, and slaves.

10.Smallpox. 天花  

According to the literature, the history of vaccination can be traced back to as early as the 7th century when the monks in India tried to immunise themselves by drinking snake 【venom】. The first vaccination was inoculation with human smallpox, a practise widely carried out in ancient India, Arabia, and China. This method of vaccination consisted of collecting pus from a patient suffering from a 【mild】 form of smallpox virus infection and 【inoculating】 the sample to a healthy human, which later led to a minor infection. This method was first introduced in England by a Greek named E. Timoni. However, this method had a risk of spreading smallpox in the community and even worsening the health condition of the person who received the inoculation. While the use of human smallpox vaccine was 【controversial】, E. Jenner came up with bovine smallpox vaccine in 1796; this new method also faced controversy but continued to be 【universalized】. Smallpox became a preventable disease by injecting pus extracted from a human infected with cowpox virus. Jenner named the substance"vaccine" after the Latin word"Vacca" which means"cow," and thus the process of giving vaccine became"vaccination."

11.Ocean floor. 海底  

The ocean floor is home to many unique communities of plants and animals. Most of these marine ecosystems are near the water surface, such as the Great Barrier Reef, 12,000-km-long coral 【formation】 off the northeastern coast of Australia. Coral reefs, like nearly all-complex living communities, depend on solar energy for growth. The sun's energy, however, penetrates at most only about 300m below the surface of the water. The relatively shallow penetration of solar energy and the sinking of cold, subpolar water combine to make most of the deep ocean floor a 【frigid】 environment with few life forms.
In 1977, scientists discovered hot spring at a depth of 2.5 km, on the Galapagos Rift, spreading ridge, off the coast of Ecuador. This exciting discovery was not really a 【surprise】. Since the early 1970s, scientists had predicted that hot springs, geothermal vents, should be found at the active spreading centres along the mid-oceanic ridges, where magma, at temperatures over 1,000 C, presumably was being erupted to form a new oceanic crust. More exciting, because it was totally 【unexpected】, was the discovery of abundant and unusual sea life-giant tube worms, huge clams, and mussels, that 【thrived】 around the hot springs.

12.Burger King. 汉堡王  

Drive down any highway, and you'll see a proliferation of chain restaurants, most likely, if you travel long and far enough, you'll see McDonald's golden arches as well as signs for Burger King, Hardee's and Wendy's the"big four" of burgers. Despite its name, though. Burger King has fallen short of 【claiming】 the burger crown, unable to surpass market leader MacDonald's No.1 sales status. Always the bridesmaid and never the bride, Burger King remains No.2.
Worse yet, Burger King has experienced a six-year 22 percent decline in customer traffic, with its overall quality rating dropping while ratings for the other three 【contenders】 have increased. The decline has been 【attributed】 to inconsistent product quality and poor customer service. Although the chain tends to throw advertising dollars at the problem, an understanding of Integrated Marketing Communications theory would suggest that internal management problems, nineteen CEOs in fifty years, need to be 【rectified】 before a unified, long-term strategy can be put in place.
The 【importance】 of consistency in brand image and messages, not at all levels of communication, has become a basic tenet of IMC theory and practise. The person who takes the customer's order must communicate the same message a Burger King's famous tagline,"have it your way" or the customer will just buzz up the highway to a chain restaurant that seems more consistent and, therefore, more 【reliable】.

13.William Shakespeare. 威廉·莎士比亚  

For all his fame and celebration, William Shakespeare remains a 【mysterious】 figure with regards to personal history. There are just two primary 【sources】 for information on the Bard: his works, and various legal and 【church】 documents that have survived from Elizabethan times. Naturally, there are many 【gaps】 in this body of information, which tells us little about Shakespeare, the man.

14.Lure New Students. 吸引新生  

In an attempt to 【lure】 new students, leading business schools, including Harvard, Stanford, the University of Chicago and Wharton, have moved away from the unofficial missions and 【prerequisite】 of four years' work experience and 【instead】 have set their sights on recent college graduates and so-called"early career" 【professionals】 with only a couple years of work under their belt.

15.Market for Vegetarian foods. 素食食品市场  

Mintel Consumer Intelligence 【estimates】 the 2002 market for vegetarian foods, those that directly replace meat or other animal products, to be 1.5 billion. Note that this excludes traditional vegetarian foods such as produce, pasta, and rice. Mintel forecasts the market to nearly double by 2006 to 2.8 billion, with the highest growth coming from soymilk, especially refrigerated brands.
The Food and Drug Administration's 1999 decision to allow manufacturers to include heart-healthy claims on foods that deliver at least 6.25 grammes of soy protein per serving and are also low in 【saturated】 fat and cholesterol has spurred 【tremendous】 interest in soymilk and other soy foods. A representative of manufacturer Food Tech International, Veggie Patch brand, reported that from 1998 to 1999, the percentage of consumers willing to try soy products jumped from 32 percent to 67 percent. Beliefs about soy's 【effectiveness】 in reducing the symptoms of menopause also attracted new consumers. A 2000 survey conducted by the United Soybean Board showed that the number of people eating soy products once a week or more was up to 27 percent. Forty-five percent of respondents had tried tofu, 41 percent had sampled veggie burgers, and 25 percent had experience with soymilk, Soyfoods USA e-mail newsletter . Mintel estimates 2001 sales of frozen and refrigerated meat 【alternatives】 in food stores at nearly 300 million, with soymilk sales nearing 250 million.

16.Indian Onion. 印度洋葱  

The most 【vital】 ingredient in Indian cooking, the 【basic】 element with which all dishes begin and, normally, the cheapest vegetable available, the pink onion is an essential item in the shopping basket of families of all classes.
A popular saying holds that you will never starve because you can always afford a roti, a piece of simple, flatbread, and an onion.
But in recent weeks, the onion has started to seem an unaffordable 【luxury】 for India's poor. Over the past few days, another sharp 【surge】 in prices has begun to unsettle the influential urban middle classes.
The sudden spike in prices has been caused by large exports to neighbouring countries and a shortage of 【supply】.
With its capacity for bringing down governments and scarring political careers, the onion plays an 【explosive】 role in Indian politics. This week, reports of rising onion prices have made front-page news and absorbed the attention of the governing elite.

17.Edison. 爱迪生  

Like Ben Franklin, Thomas Alva Edison was 【both】 a scientist and an inventor. Born in 1847, Edison would see 【tremendous】 change take place in his lifetime. He was also to be responsible for making many of those changes occur. When Edison was born, society still thought of electricity as a 【novelty】, a fad. By the time he died, entire cities were lit by electricity. Much of the credit for that progress goes to Edison. In his lifetime, Edison patented 1,093 inventions, earning him the nickname"The Wizard of Menlo Park" The most famous of his inventions was the incandescent light bulb. Besides the light bulb, Edison developed the phonograph and the"kinetoscope," a small box for viewing moving films. He also 【improved】 upon the original design of the stock ticker, the telegraph, and Alexander Graham Bell's telephone. He believed in hard work, sometimes working twenty hours a day. Edison was quoted as saying,"Genius is one percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration." In 【tribute】 to this important American, electric lights in the United States were dimmed for one minute on October 21, 1931, a few days after his death.

18.United Nations. 联合国  

Founded after World War the second by 51' peace-loving states' combined to oppose future aggression, the United Nations now counts 192 member nations, 【including】 its newest member, Nauru, Kiribati, and Tonga in 1999, Tuvalu and Yugoslavia in 2000, Switzerland and East Timor in 2002, and Montenegro in 2006.
United Nations Day has been 【observed】 on October 24th since 1948 and celebrates the objectives and accomplishments of the organisation, which was established on October 24th, 1945.
The UN 【engages】 in peacekeeping and humanitarian missions conflict 【prevention】 across the globe. Though some say its 【influence】 has declined in recent decades, the United Nations still plays a tremendous role in world politics. In 2001 the United Nations and Kofi Annan, then Secretary-General of the UN, won the Nobel Peace Prize' for their work for a better organised and more peaceful world.'
Since 1948 there have been 63 UN peacekeeping operations 16 are currently underway. Thus far, close to 130 nations have contributed personnel at various times; 119 are currently providing peacekeepers. As of August 31, 2008, there were 16 peacekeeping operations underway with a total of 88,230 personnel. The small island nation of Fiji has taken part in virtually every UN peacekeeping operation, as has Canada.

19.English class. 英语课  

There were twenty-six freshmen 【majoring】 in English at Beijing Language Institute in the class of 1983, and I was assigned to Group Two with another eleven boys and girls who had come from big cities in China. I was 【told】 that language study required smallness so that we would get more attention from the skillful teachers. The better the school, the smaller the class.
I realised that my classmates were already all 【talking】 in English, simple sentences tossed out to each other in their red-faced introductions and carefree chatting. Their intonations were curving and dramatic and their pronunciation refined and accurate. But as I stretched to catch the drips and drops of their humming dialogue, I couldn't 【understand】 it all, only that it was English. Those words now flying before me sounded a little familiar. I had read them and tried to speak them, but I had never heard them 【spoken】 back to me in such a speedy, fluent manner. My big plan of 【beating】 the city folks was thawing before my eyes.

20.Kimbell. 金贝尔（美术馆）  

The first section of the book covers new modes of assessment. In Chapter 1, Kimbell, Goldsmith College, London responds to 【criticisms】 of design programmes as formalistic and conventional, stating that a focus on risk-taking than hard work in design innovation is equally problematic. His research contains three parts that include preliminary exploration of design innovation qualities, investigation of resulting classroom practises, and development of the evidence-based assessment. The assessment he describes is presented in the form of a structured worksheet, which includes a 【collaborative】 【element】 and digital photographs, in story format. Such a device encourages stimulating ideas but does not recognise students as design 【innovators】. The assessment sheet includes holistic impressions as well as details about"having, growing, and proving" ideas. 【Colloquial】 judgements are evident in terms such as"wow" and"yawn" and reward the quality and quantity of ideas with the term,"sparkiness," which fittingly is a pun as the model project was to design light bulb packaging. In addition, the assessment focuses on the process of optimising or complexity control as well as proving ideas with thoughtful criticism and not just generation of novel ideas. The definitions for qualities such as"technical" and"aesthetic" pertaining to users are too narrow and ill-defined. The author provides 【examples】 of the project, its features and structures, students' notes and judgements, and their sketches and photographs of finished light bulb packages, in the Appendix.

21.Jean Piaget. 让·皮亚杰  

Jean Piaget, the pioneering Swiss philosopher, and psychologist spent much of his professional life listening to children, watching children and 【poring】 over reports of researchers around the world who were doing the same. He found, to put most 【succinctly】, that children don't think like grownups. After thousands of interactions with young people often barely old enough to talk, Piaget began to 【suspect】 that behind their cute and seemingly illogical utterances were thought processes that had their own kind of order and their own special logic. Einstein called it a 【discovery】"so simple that only a genius could have thought of it."
Piaget's insight opened a new window into the inner workings of the mind. By the end of a wide-ranging and remarkably 【prolific】 research career that spanned nearly 75 years, from his first scientific publication at age 10 to work still in progress when he died at 84, Piaget had developed several new fields of science: developmental psychology, cognitive theory and what came to be called genetic epistemology. Although not an educational reformer, he 【fashioned】 a way of thinking about children that provided the foundation for today's education-reform 【movements】. It was a shift comparable to the displacement of stories of"noble savages" and"cannibals" by modern anthropology. One might say that Piaget was the first to take children's thinking seriously.

22.Eiffel. 埃菲尔（铁塔）  

The Eiffel Tower was the tallest building in the world when it was completed in 1889. It was built for the World's Fair to 【demonstrate】 that iron could be as strong as a stone while being infinitely lighter. And in fact, the wrought-iron tower is twice as tall as the masonry Washington Monument, and yet it weighs 70,000 tonnes less! It is repainted every seven years with 50 tonnes of dark brown paint.
Called"the father of the skyscraper," the Home Insurance Building, 【constructed】 in Chicago in 1885, and demolished in 1931 , was 138 feet tall and ten stories. It was the first building to effectively employ a supporting 【skeleton】 of steel beams and columns, allowing it to have many more windows than traditional masonry structures. But this new construction method made people worry that the building would fall down, leading the city to halt construction until they could 【investigate】 the structure's safety.
In 1929, auto tycoon Walter Chrysler took part in an intense race with the Bank of Manhattan Trust Company to build the world's tallest skyscraper. Just when it looked like the bank had captured the 【coveted】 title, workers at the Chrysler Building jacked a thin spire hidden inside the building through the top of the roof to win the contest, subsequently losing the title four months later to the Empire State Building. Chrysler also decorated his building to mirror his cars, with hubcaps, mudguards, and hood ornaments.

23.Seatbelt. 安全带  

I am a cyclist and a motorist. I fasten my seatbelt when I drive and wear a helmet on my bike to reduce the risk of injury. I am convinced that these are 【prudent】 safety measures. I have persuaded many friends to wear helmets on the grounds that transplant surgeons call those without helmets,"donors on wheels". But a book on' Risk' by my colleague John Adams has made me re- examine my 【convictions】. Adams has completely 【undermined】 my confidence in these apparently sensible precautions. What he has persuasively argued, particularly in relation to seat belts, is that the evidence that they do what they are supposed to do is very suspect. This is 【in spite】 of numerous claims that seat belts save many thousands of lives every year. Between 1970 and 1978 countries in which the wearing of seat belts is 【compulsory】 had on average about five percent more road accident death than before the introduction of law. In the United Kingdom road deaths decreased steadily about seven thousand a year in.

24.Definition of Country. 国家的定义  

What is a country, and how is a country defined? When people ask how many countries there are in the world, they expect a simple answer. After all, we've explored the 【whole】 planet; we have international travel, satellite navigation and plenty of global organisations like the United Nations, 【so】 we should really know how many countries there are! However, the answer to the question varies according to whom you ask. 【most】 people say there are 192 countries, but others point out that there could be more like 260 of them. So why isn't there a straightforward answer? The problem 【arises】 because there isn't a universally agreed definition of' country' and because, for political reasons, some countries 【find】 it convenient to recognise or not recognise 【other】 countries.

25.National Sustainable Development Strategies. 国家可持续发展战略  

The principal recommendation of the world conferences was that countries must take full responsibility for their own development. National responsibility for national development is the necessary consequence of 【sovereignty】. The Monterrey Consensus states that' Each country has primary responsibility for its own economic and social development, and the role of national policies and development strategies cannot be 【over-emphasized】. The Johannesburg Plan of 【Implementation】 called for all governments to begin implementing national sustainable development strategies, NSDS, by 2005 and the 2005 Summit agreed on a target to achieve the internationally agreed goals. The automatic 【corollary】 of that principle is that each country must be free to determine its own development strategy. It is essential that all donors and lenders accept the principle of country ownership of national development strategies. This implies the acceptance of the principle that development strategies should not only be 【attuned】 to country circumstances but also be prepared and implemented under the leadership of the governments of the countries themselves, The 2005 World Summit also acknowledge, in this regard, that all countries must recognise the need for developing countries to strike a 【balance】 between their national policy priorities and their international commitments.

26.Australian Overseas Departures. 澳大利亚出境人数  

Over the past ten years, Australian overseas departures have grown from 1.7 million to 3.2 million. This represents the strong average, annual growth of 6.5 percent. This paper 【analyses】 outbound travel demand to each destination country using the travel demand models of short-term resident departures. The models are specified in terms of a double logarithmic linear functional form, with overseas departures as the dependent variable and real household disposable income prices of travel and accommodation in Australia, and overseas and the exchange rate as independent 【variables】.
The models were estimated using historical time series data from 1973 to 1998. The data were obtained from several 【sources】 such as the World Tourism Organization, Australian Bureau of Statistics, World Bank and International Monetary Fund. The results suggest that the estimated elasticity parameters are consistent with standard economic theory. The number of short-term resident departures are positively influenced by per capita real household disposable income; and the price of domestic travel and accommodation are 【negatively】 influenced by the price of travel and accommodation overseas.
The estimated demand models were used to develop the Tourism Forecasting Council's long-run forecasts. The forecasts suggest that the number of short-term resident departures will increase strongly over the next ten years, largely due to the strength of the Australian economy, competitive trove prices, and Australians' interests in 【experiencing】 different cultures and lifestyles.

27.Late payment. 逾期付款  

There isn't a financial director around who wouldn't like to 【accelerate】 cash flow by reducing debtor days, in other words, get customers to pay up faster. In Europe's top 1, 000 quoted companies, nearly one-quarter of all invoices are unpaid at any 【point】 in time, according to recent research carried out by the ASF organisation. This means they are sitting on a total of 274bn overdue debt. Most of this is caused by poor collection practises. According to Jan Porter, ASF's Managing Director," You can set up all the systems you want, you can insist on 【watertight】 contracts and payment terms, the government can even introduce late payment legislation, but there are always some debtors who 【fail】 to pay on time. Once payment is overdue, your first step is to talk to your debtor. You should let them know the payment is late and try to find out if there is a dispute about the work, or if your debtor has financial problems. This is OK, but Tim Vainio, a chartered accountant, believes that too many companies are afraid of losing a relationship, and that, before 【undertaking】 any action, the focus should be in recovering as much money as possible, rather than on preserving a relationship.

28.Father's books. 父亲的书籍  

None of the books in my father's dusty old bookcase were 【forbidden】. Yet while I was growing up, I never saw anyone take one down. Most were 【massive】 tomes, a comprehensive history of civilization, matching volumes of the great works of western literature, numerous others I can no longer 【recall】- that seemed almost fused to 【shelves】 that bowed slightly from decades of 【steadfast】 support.

29.Folklore. 民俗  

Folklore, a modern term for the 【body】 of traditional customs, superstitions, stories, dances, and songs that have been adopted and maintained within a given 【community】 by processes of repetition is not reliant on the written word. Along with folk songs and folktales, this broad 【category】 of cultural forms embraces all kinds of legends, riddles, jokes, proverbs, games, charms, omens, spells, and rituals, especially those of pre-literate societies or social classes. Those forms of verbal expression that are handed on from one generation or locality to the next by 【word】 of the mouth are said to constitute an oral 【tradition】.

30.Outer space. 外太空  

Researchers already know that spending long periods of time in a zero-gravity 【environment】, such as that inside the International Space Station, ISS, result in loss of bone density and 【damage】 to the body's 【muscles】. That's partly why stays aboard the ISS are 【restricted】 at six months. And now, a number of NASA astronauts are reporting that their 20 or 30 【vision】 【deteriorated】 after spending time in space, with many needing glasses once they returned to Earth.

31.Oxford medical school. 牛津医学院  

When I enroled in my master's course at Oxford last year, I had come straight from medical school with the decision to leave clinical science for good. Thinking back, I realise that I didn't put very much 【weight】 on this decision at the time. But today, I more clearly understand the 【consequences】 of leaving my original profession. When I meet old friends who are now physicians and surgeons, I sense how our views on medical problems have 【diverged】. They scrutinise the effects of disease and try to eliminate or alleviate them; I try to understand how they come about in the first place. I feel happier working on this side of the problem, although I do occasionally miss clinical work and seeing patients.
However, when I think about the rate at which my medical skills and knowledge have 【dissipated】, the years spent reading weighty medical textbooks, the hours spent at the bedside, I sometimes wonder if these years were partly a 【waste】 of time now that I am pursuing a research career.
Nonetheless, I know the value of my medical education. It is easy to forget the importance of the biosciences when working with model organisms in basic research that seem to have nothing to do with a sick child or a suffering elderly person. Yet, I still have vivid memories of the cruel kaleidoscope of severe diseases and of how they can 【strike】 a human being. I hope to retain these memories as a guide in my current occupation.

32.Movement in painting. 绘画中的运动表现  

Movement in painting that 【originated】 in France in the 1860s and had enormous influence in European and North American painting in the late 19th century. The Impressionists wanted to 【depict】 real life, to paint straight from nature, and to capture the changing effects of light. The term was first used abusively to describe Claude Monet's painting Impression: Sunrise. The other leading Impressionists included Paul Camile, Edger Degas, Edouard, Manet, Camille Pissarro, Pierre Auguste Renoir, and Alfred Sisley, but only Monet remained devoted to Impressionist ideas throughout his career.
The core of the Impressionist group was formed in the early 1860s by Monet, Renoir, and Sisley, who met as students and enjoyed painting in the open air, one of the hallmarks of Impressionism. They met other members of the Impressionist circle through Paris cafe society. They never made up a formal group, but they organised eight group exhibitions between 1874 and 1886, at the first of which the name Impressionism was applied. Their styles were diverse, but all 【experimented】 with effects of light and movement created with distinct brush strokes and 【fragments】 of colour dabbed side-by-side on the canvas rather than mixed on the palette. By the 1880s the movement's central impulse had dispersed, and a number of new styles were emerging, later described as post-impressionism.
British Impressionism had a major influence on the more 【experimental】 and progressive British painters in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Many of the painters were affected in the circle of Walter Sickert, who spent much of his career in France and was an influential figure who 【inspired】 many younger artists. His friend and exact contemporary Philip Wilson Steer is generally regarded as the most outstanding British Impressionist.

33.Locust. 蝗虫  

Fancy a locust for lunch? Probably not, if you live in the west, but elsewhere it's a different story. Edible insects, termites, stick insects, dragonflies, grasshoppers and giant water bugs, are on the menu for an 【estimated】 80 percent of the world's population.
More than 1000 species of insects are 【served】 up around the world. For example,"Kungu cakes", made from midges, are a 【delicacy】 in parts of Africa. Mexico is an insect-eating- or entomophagous-hotspot, where more than 200 insect species are consumed. 【Demand】 is so high that 40 species are now under 【threat】, including white agave worms. These caterpillars of the tequila giant-skipper butterfly 【fetch】 around 250 a kilogramme.
Eating insects make nutritional sense. Some contain more protein than meat or fish. The female gypsy moth, for instance, is about 80 percent protein. Insects can be a good 【source】 of vitamins and minerals too: a type of caterpillar, Usta Terpsichore, eaten in Angola is rich in iron, zinc, and thiamine. What do they taste like? Ants have a lemon tang, apparently, whereas giant water bugs taste of mint and fire ant pupae of watermelon. You have probably, inadvertently, already tasted some of these things, as insects are often accidental tourists in other types of food. The US Food and Drug Administration even issues guidelines for the number of insect parts allowed in certain foods. For example, it is 【acceptable】 for 225 grammes of macaroni to contain up to 225 insect fragments.

34.Visual art. 视觉艺术  

It is the assertion of this article that students who use visual art as a prewriting stimulus are composing their ideas both in images and in words. The result of the art creation process allows students the distance to 【elaborate】, add details, and create more coherent text. The process of writing is more than putting words on a piece of paper. Effective authors are able to create 【imagery】 and to communicate ideas using well-chosen words, phrases, and text structures. Emergent writers struggle with the 【mechanics】 of the writing process, i. e., fine motor control for printing legibly, recall of spelling patterns, and the use of syntax and grammar rules. As a result, texts written by young writers tend to be simplistic and formulaic. The artwork 【facilitates】 the writing process, resulting in a text that is richer in sensory detail and more 【intricate】 than the more traditional writing-first crayon drawing-second approach.

35.Morality of the welfare system. 福利制度的道德性  

The morality of the welfare state depends on contribution and responsibility. Since some people don't contribute and many are irresponsible, the choices of those who do contribute and are responsible are either to 【tolerate】 the free riders, refuse to pay for the 【effects】 of their irresponsibility or trust the state to 【educate】 them.

36.The horned desert viper. 角蝰蛇  

The horned desert viper's ability to hunt at night always has puzzled biologists. Though it lies with its 【head】 buried in the sand, it can strike with great precision as soon as prey appears. Now, Young and physicists Leo van Hemmen and Paul Friedel at the Technical University of Munich in Germany have developed a computer model of the snake's auditory 【system】 to explain how the snake"hears" its prey without really having the ears for it. Although the vipers have 【internal】 ears that can hear 【frequencies】 between 200 and 1,000 hertz, it is not the sound of the mouse scurrying about that they are detecting."The snakes don't have external 【eardrums】," says van Hemmen."So unless the mouse wears boots and starts stamping, the snake won't hear it."

37.Transitions. 过渡  

The school-to-work transition is a historically 【persistent】 topic of education policymaking and reform that impacts national systems of vocational education and training. The transition process refers to a period between 【completion】 of general education and the beginning of vocational education or the beginning of gainful employment as well as to training systems, institutions, and programmes that prepare young people for careers. The status passage of youth from school-to-work has changed structurally under late modernism, and young people are forced to adapt to changing 【demands】 of their environment especially when planning for entry into the labour market. While some young people have developed 【successful】 strategies to cope with these requirements, those undereducated and otherwise disadvantaged in society often face serious problems when trying to prepare for careers. Longer transitions lead to greater vulnerability and to risky 【behaviours】.

38.Australia Higher Education Funding. 澳大利亚高等教育经费  

Financing of Australian higher education has undergone dramatic change since the early 1970s. Although the Australian Government provided regular funding for universities from the late 1950s, in 1974, it 【assumed】 full responsibility for funding higher education, abolishing tuition fees with the intention of making university 【accessible】 to all Australians who had the ability and who wished to participate in higher education.
Since the late 1980s, there has been a move towards greater private contributions, 【particularly】 students fees. In 1989, the Australian Government 【introduced】 the Higher Education Contribution Scheme which included a loans scheme to help students finance their contributions. This enabled universities to remain accessible to students by delaying their payments until they could afford to pay off their loans. In 2002, the Australian Government introduced a scheme similar to HECS for postgraduate students, the Postgraduate Education Loan Scheme.
Funding for higher education comes from various sources. This article examines the three main sources, Australian Government funding, students fees and charges, and HECS. While the proportion of total 【revenue】 raised through HECS is relatively small, HECS payments are a significant component of students' university costs, with many students carrying a HECS debt for several years after leaving university. This article also focuses on characteristics of university students based on their HECS liability status, and the level of accumulated HECS debt.

39.Carbon Detox. 碳排毒  

In his 【fascinating】 book Carbon Detox, George Marshall argues that people are not persuaded by information. Our views are formed by the views of the people with whom we mix. Of the 【narratives】 that might penetrate these circles, we are more likely to listen to those that offer us some reward. A story that tells us that the world is cooking and that we'll have to make sacrifices for the sake of future generations is less likely to be accepted than the more rewarding idea that climate change is a conspiracy hatched by scheming governments and venal scientists, and that strong, independent-minded people should unite to defend their freedoms.
He proposes that instead of arguing for sacrifice, 【environmentalists】 should show where the rewards might lie: that understanding what the science is saying and planning accordingly is the smart thing do, which will protect your interests more effectively than flinging 【abuse】 at scientists. We should 【emphasise】 the old-fashioned virtues of uniting in the face of a crisis, of resourcefulness and community action. Projects like the transition town's network and proposals for a green new deal tell a story which people are more willing to hear.

40.Social Isolation. 社会隔离  

Sound depressing, even apocalyptic? Well, it could be the future. If government 【forecasts】 are right, about 20 years from now, two out of five households will be single 【occupancy】. And there is evidence the situation is already 【deteriorating】. According to a report, Social Isolation in America, published in American Sociological Review in 2006, the average American today has only two close friends. Twenty-five percent of those surveyed said they do not have anyone to talk with about important things. And yet, while some are 【declaring】 a crisis in our ability to make friends, others are saying exactly the opposite. For example, MSN's Anatomy of Friendship Report, published last November, suggests that the average Briton has 54 friends, a 【spectacular】 rise of 64 percent since 2003.

41.Essays. 论文  

Essays are used as an assessment tool to 【evaluate】 your ability to research a topic and construct an 【argument】, as well as your understanding of subject content. This does not mean that essays are a' regurgitation' of everything your lecture has said 【throughout】 the course. Essays are your opportunity to explore in greater 【depth】.

42.Ikebana. 花道  

More than simply putting flowers in a 【container】, Ikebana is a 【disciplined】 art form in which nature and humanity are brought together. Contrary to the 【idea】 of a particolored or multicoloured 【arrangement】 of blossoms, Ikebana often emphasises other areas of the 【plant】, such as its stems and leaves, and puts emphasis on shape, line, and form.
Though Ikebana is an 【expression】 of creativity, certain rules govern its form. The artist's intention behind each arrangement is shown through a piece's colour combinations, natural shapes, graceful lines, and the implied meaning of the arrangement.

43.Heart disease. 心脏病  

If you have a 【chronic】 disease such as heart disease, diabetes, asthma, or back or joint pain, exercise can have important health 【benefits】. However, it is important to talk to your doctor before starting an exercise 【routine】. He or she might have 【advice】 on what exercises are safe and any precautions you might need to take while exercising.

44.Poverty. 贫困  

Measuring poverty on a global scale 【requires】 establishing a 【uniform】 poverty level across extremely divergent economies, which can result in only rough comparisons. The World Bank has defined the international poverty line as U.S. 1$ and 2$ per day in 1993 Purchasing Power Parity, which adjusts for differences in the 【prices】 of goods and services between countries. The 1$ per day level is generally used for the 【least】 developed countries, primarily African; the 2-per-day level is used for middle 【income】 economies such as those of East Asia and Latin America.

45.Impressionist. 印象派画家  

Impressionism was a nineteenth-century art movement that began as a loose association of Paris-based artists who started publicly exhibiting their art in the 1860s. Characteristics of Impressionist painting include visible brush strokes, light colours, open composition, 【emphasis】 on light in its changing qualities, often accentuating the effects of the passage of time, ordinary subject matter, and unusual visual angles. The name of the movement is 【derived】 from Claude Monet's Impression, Sunrise, Impression, Soleil Levant. Critic Louis Leroy inadvertently coined the term in a satiric review published in Le Charivari.
Radicals in their time, early Impressionists broke the rules of academic painting. They began by giving colours, freely brushed, primacy over line, drawing 【inspiration】 from the work of painters such as Eugene Delacroix. They also took the 【act】 of painting out of the studio and into the world. Previously, not only still lives and portraits, but also landscapes had been painted indoors, but the Impressionists found that they could 【capture】 the momentary and transient effects of sunlight by painting air, in plain air.

46.Pinker. 平克（心理学家）  

In a sequence of bestsellers, including The Language Instinct and How the Mind Works, Pinker has argued the swathes of our mental, social and emotional lives may have 【originated】 as evolutionary adaptions, well suited to the lives our ancestors eked out on the Pleistocene savannah. Sometimes it seems as if nothing is 【immune】 from being explained this way. Road rage, adultery, marriage, altruism, our tendency to reward senior executives with corner offices on the top floor, and the smaller number of women who become mechanical engineers all may have their 【roots】 in natural selection, Pinker claims. The controversial implications are obvious: that men and women might 【differ】 in their inborn abilities at performing certain tasks, for example, or that parenting may have 【little】 influence on personality.

47.Video-conferencing technology. 视频会议技术  

Never has the carbon footprint of multi-national corporations been under such intense scrutiny. Inter-city train journeys and long-haul flights to 【conduct】 face-to-face business meetings contribute significantly to greenhouse gases and the resulting 【strain】 on the environment.
The Anglo-US company Teliris has introduced a new video-conferencing technology and partnered with the Carbon Neutral Company, enabling corporate outfits to become more environmentally responsible. The innovation allows simulated face-to-face meetings to be held across continents without the time 【pressure】 or environmental burden of international travel.
Previous designs have enabled video-conferencing on a point-to-point, dual-location basis. The firm's VirtuaLive technology, however, can bring people together from up to five 【separate】 locations anywhere in the world, with 【unrivalled】 transmission quality.

48.Professor Phoenix. 菲尼克斯教授  

Moreover, for Professor David Phoenix, the dean of the faculty of science and technology, the return of single-honors 【chemistry】 is a 【matter】 of credibility and pride."If you say you're a science faculty, you have to have all the core sciences, and this course will mean we attract a new supply of potential Masters and PhD students in chemistry."
Phoenix is adamant that the new course will teach solid chemistry, but he thinks that an attraction for students will be a teaching approach that 【differs】 significantly from his days as an undergraduate. This takes real-life issues as the starting point of lectures and modules, such as how drugs are made or the science behind green issues. Out of this study, he says, students will be exposed to the same core chemistry unchanged over decades, but they will be doing it in a way that is more 【engaging】 and more likely to lead to more fundamental learning. It is an approach that 【symbolises】 chemistry's recent success story: moving with the times, while holding fast to the subject's essential role as a building block of science and technological advance.

49.Monkey. 猴子  

This 【illustration】 often used is the one that the monkeys and the 【typewriters】. Ok, we have a monkey sitting at a typewriter, and the claim here is basically if you leave to chance in a time long enough you will get a life, don't worry about it, yes it's strange. Yes, it's wonderful: but leave enough matter 600 million years on earth, and you will have the life. So, the monkey sitting at the typewriter, the chances are eventually he produces the complete works of Shakespeare Douglass the problem. So there's no problem. There is no issue: right? You just leave it long enough, and you'll find. And one key striker seconds, the monkey might well eventually get to you the complete works of Shakespeare, but he doesn't manage to do it in 600 million years. So what I decided to do is to run the numbers. I instead of saying typing the complete work of Shakespeare, I just run the number for how long would it take a monkey typing one key striker a second. To type to be or not to be that is the question. Right? On average how Iong is it taking my monkey friend one keystroke a second. I don't know how you think it would be. Maybe you could have a guess. Would it be less or more than 600 million years which is the period life on earth isn't supposed to have emerged within and when I run the numbers to be or not? To be that is the question takes 12 points six trillion trillion trillion years to type just that phrase, and a DNA 【string】 has got as much as information the 【encyclopaedia】 Britannica. Are we saying that something of that complexity emerges by chance undirected within 600 million years? Again, it's mathematically possible but ifs so incredibly unlikely that it would have that it 【tilts】 me in favour of the Cristian story in which God is creating life simply a question of saying let that be, and there was.

50.Learning by Doing. 做中学  

An analysis of more than 500 graduates found no significant difference between business schools that offered traditional courses and those that emphasise a' learning- by- doing' approach to entrepreneurship education. The research challenges the ongoing trend across higher education institutes' HEIs' of 【focusing】 on experiential learning, and suggests that universities need to reconsider their approach if they 【are to】 increase entrepreneurship among their students. Ms Inna Kozlinska, research associate at Aston Business School and author of the study, said:' Entrepreneurship education 【is seen】 as a major force capable of generating long- term socio- economic changes through developing entrepreneurial, creative, flexible and wise individuals. There is an ongoing shift towards experiential learning in business schools, 【yet】 there is little empirical evidence to suggest this approach has better impact than traditional learning.'

51.Space work. 太空作业  

The space work for an astronaut can be inside or outside, inside they can monitor machines, and the work is 【carried】 out alongside the craft. They also need to make sure the Space 【Travel】. 【Outside】 the craft, they can see how the seeds react in the space. Some seeds company send seeds to them to 【investigate】 how seeds change their biological character. When outside the craft, they can set 【up】 experiments or clean up the space rubbish.

52.Dog. 狗  

A DOG may be man's best friend. But man is not always a dog's. Over the centuries 【selective】 breeding has pulled at the canine body shape to produce what is often a grotesque distortion of the underlying wolf. Indeed, some of these distortions are, when found in people, regarded as 【pathologies】. Dog breeding does, though, offer a chance to those who would like to understand how body shape is controlled. The ancestry of pedigree pooches is well recorded, their generation time is short and their 【litter】 size reasonably large, so there is plenty of material to work with. 【Moreover】, breeds are, by definition, inbred, and this simplifies genetic analysis. Those such as Elaine Ostrander, of America's National Human Genome Research Institute, who wish to identify the genetic basis of the features of particular pedigrees thus have an 【ideal】 experimental animal.

53.Parliament. 议会  

No one in Parliament would know better than Peter Garrett what largesse copyright can confer so it may seem right that he should announce a 【royalty】 for artists, amounting to 5 percent of all sales after the original one, which can go on giving to their families for as much as 150 years. But that ignores the truth that copyright law is a 【scandal】, recently 【exacerbated】 by the Free Trade Agreement with the US which 【required】 the extension of copyright to 70 years after death.
Is it scandalous that really valuable copyrights end up in the ownership of corporations, although Agatha Christie's no-doubt worthy great-grandchildren are still 【reaping】 the benefits of West End success for her whodunnits and members of the Garrick Club enjoy the continuing fruits of A.A. Milne's Christopher Robin books? No. The 【scandals】 are that bien peasants politicians have attempted to appear cultured by creating private assets which depend on an act of Parliament for their existence and by giving away much more in value than any public benefit could 【justify】. In doing so, they have betrayed our trust.

54.Egg-eating snakes. 食蛋蛇  

Egg-eating snakes are a small group of snakes whose 【diet】 consists only of eggs. Some eat only bird's eggs, which they have to swallow 【whole】, as the snake has no teeth. Instead, some other snakes eat bigger eggs, but it requires special 【treatment】. These snakes have spines that stick out from the backbone. The spines 【crack】 the egg 【open】 as it passes through the throat.
Once the egg is 【punctured】, muscles in the snake's body work in waves to 【squeeze】 out the contents, which then move down into the stomach. The snake then forces the shell back into its mouth by bending its body into an' S' shape. The shell is now drained and flattened into a compact shape. Egg eating snakes sometimes have to go for a long time without any food. So, they eat as many eggs as they can when they get them!

55.Artists. 艺术家  

In the U.S., artists in the mid-1950s began to create a 【bridge】 to Pop. Strongly influenced by Dada and its 【emphasis】 on appropriation and everyday objects, artists increasingly worked with 【collage】, consumer products, and a healthy dose of irony. Jasper Johns 【reimagined】 iconic imagery like the American flag Robert Rauschenberg employed silk-screen printings and found objects and Larry Rivers used images of mass-produced goods. All three are considered American 【forerunners】 of Pop.

56.Job-hunting. 求职  

When it comes to job-hunting, first 【impressions】 are critical. Remember, you are marketing a product, yourself, to a potential employer. The first thing the employer sees when greeting you is your 【attire】; thus, you must make every effort to have the proper dress for the type of job you are seeking. Will dressing properly get you the job? Of course not, but it will give you a competitive edge and a 【positive】 first impression.
Should you be judged by what you wear? Perhaps not, but the reality is, of course, that you are judged. Throughout the entire job-seeking process employers use short-cuts, heuristics or rules of thumb, to save time. With cover letters, it's the opening paragraph and a quick scan of your qualifications. With resumes, it is a quick scan of your accomplishments. With the job interview, it's how you're dressed that sets the 【tone】 of the interview.
How should you dress? Dressing conservatively is always the safest route, but you should also try and do a little 【investigation】 of your 【prospective】 employer so that what you wear to the interview makes you look as though you 【fit】 in with the organisation. If you overdress, which is rare but can happen, or underdress, the more likely scenario, the potential employer may feel that you don't care enough about the job.

57.Votes. 投票  

It is tempting to try to prove that good looks win votes, and many academics have tried. The 【difficulty】 is that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and you cannot behold a politician's face without a veil of extraneous 【prejudice】 getting in the way. Does George Bush possess a disarming grin or a facetious 【smirk】? It's hard to find anyone who can look at the president without assessing him politically as well as 【physically】.

58.Animals coordination. 动物协作  

In animals, a movement is coordinated by a cluster of neurons in the spinal cord called the central patterns generator, CPG. This produces signals that drive muscles to 【contract】 rhythmically in a way that produces running or walking, depending on the 【pattern】 of pulses. A simple signal from the brain instructs the CPG to switch between different 【modes】, such as going from a standstill to walking.

59.Alaska's Aleutian Islands. 阿拉斯加阿留申群岛  

The few people who live in Alaska's the Aleutian Islands have long been accustomed to shipwrecks. They have been part of local consciousness since a Japanese whaling ship ran 【aground】 near the western end of the 1,100-mile, 1,800-km, volcanic 【archipelago】 in 1780, inadvertently naming what is now Rat Island when the ship's infestation 【scurried】 ashore and made itself at home. Since then, there have been at least 190 shipwrecks in the islands.

60.Australia and New Zealand. 澳大利亚与新西兰  

Australia and New Zealand have many common links. Both countries were recently settled by Europeans, are predominantly English speaking and in that sense, share a common cultural 【heritage】. Although in close proximity to one another, both countries are geographically isolated and have small populations by world 【standards】. They have similar histories and enjoy 【close】 relations on many fronts. In terms of population 【characteristics】, Australia and New Zealand have much in common. Both countries have minority indigenous populations, and during the latter half of the 20th century have seen a steady stream of migrants from a variety of regions throughout the world. Both countries have 【experienced】 similar declines in fertility since the high levels recorded during the baby boom, and alongside this have enjoyed the benefits of continually improving life expectancy. One consequence of these trends is that both countries are faced with an ageing population, and the 【associated】 challenge of providing appropriate care and support for this growing group within the community.

61.Device of Drying Hay. 干草干燥装置  

A novel device for helping farmers to dry out hay more quickly has won a University of Glasgow graduate a prestigious design award. Gavin Armstrong, 23, from Kippen, Stirlingshire 【scooped】 the Glasgow 1999 Design Medal for his design for a swath inverter, a 【device】 for flipping over a hay crop to help dry out the damp underside. Dry hay is an essential farmyard food source for sheep and cows. Gavin came up 【with】 the design as part of his Product Design Engineering degree course, run in 【conjunction】 with Glasgow School of Art. He built a working prototype of the device which is powered and towed by a tractor and uses a pair of parallel belts to invert the swath. The rollers are driven from one hydraulic motor and are geared so as to spin at the same speed and in opposite directions 【ensuring】 that the touching inner two faces of the belt that perform the inversion move rearwards at the same speed.

62.Serving on a jury. 担任陪审员  

Serving on a jury is normally compulsory for individuals who are 【qualified】 for jury service. A jury is 【intended】 to be an impartial panel capable of reaching a verdict. There are often 【Procedures】 and requirements, including a fluent understanding of the language and the opportunity to test jurors' neutrality or otherwise exclude jurors who are perceived as likely to be less than 【neutral】 or partial to one side.

63.Investment. 投资  

One city will start to attract the 【majority】 of public or private investment. This could be due to 【natural】 advantage or political decisions. This, in turn, will 【stimulate】 further investment due to the multiplier effect and 【significant】 rural to urban migration. The investment in this city will be at the 【expense】 of other cities.

64.Andersen’s tales. 安徒生童话  

Fans of biographical criticism have a luxurious source in the works of Hans Christian Andersen. Like Lewis Carroll, and, to a lesser extent, Kenneth Grahame, Andersen was near-pathologically uncomfortable in the company of adults. Of course, all three had to work and 【interact】 with adults, but all three really related well to children and their simpler worlds. Andersen, for a time, ran a puppet theatre and was incredibly popular with children, and, of course, he wrote an impressive body of fairy tales which have been produced in thousands of editions since the 19th century.
Most everyone has read or at least knows the titles of many of Andersen's works:"The Ugly Duckling,""The Emperor's New Clothes,""The Nightengale,""The Little Mermaid,""The Match Girl," and many others. Though, as with most folk and fairy tales, they 【strike】 adult re-readers much differently than they do young first-time readers.
Charming tales of ducks who feel 【awkward】 because they don't fit in, only to exult in the discovery that they are majestic swans, gives child readers clearly-identifiable messages: don't tease people because they're different; don't fret about your being different because someday you'll discover what special 【gifts】 you have. A closer, deeper look at many of Andersen's tales, including"The Ugly Duckling," which is not on our reading list, reveals a darker, harder, more 【painful】 thread. People are often cruel and unfeeling, love is torturous, in general, the things of the material world cause suffering. There is often a happy ending, but it's not conventionally happy. Characters are rewarded, but only after they manage, often through death, to transcend the rigours of the mortal world.

65.Dairy farms. 奶牛场  

A few summers ago I visited two dairy farms, Huls Farm and Gardar Farm, which despite being located thousands of miles apart were still remarkably similar in their strengths and vulnerabilities. Both were by far the largest, most prosperous, most technologically advanced farms in their 【respective】 districts. In particular, each was centred around a magnificent state-of-the-art barn for 【sheltering】 and milking cows. Those structures, both neatly 【divided】 into opposite-facing rows of cow stalls, dwarfed all other barns in the district. Both farms let their cows graze outdoors in lush pastures during the summer, produced their hay to harvest in the late summer for feeding the cows through the winter, and 【increased】 their production of summer fodder and winter hay by 【irrigating】 their fields. The two farms were similar in an area, a few square miles, and barn size, Huls barn holding somewhat more cows than Gardar barn, 200 vs 165 cows, respectively. The owners of both farms were viewed as leaders of their respective societies. Both owners were deeply religious. Both farms were located in gorgeous natural settings that attract tourists from afar, with backdrops of high snow-capped mountains drained by streams teaming with fish, and sloping down to a famous river, below Huls Farm, or fjord, below Gardar Farm.

66.Dark energy. 暗能量  

The rest of the universe appears to be made of a mysterious, invisible 【substance】 called dark matter and a force that repels gravity known as dark energy. Scientists have not yet 【observed】 dark matter directly. It doesn't interact with baryonic matter, and it's completely invisible to light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation, making dark matter 【impossible】 to 【detect】 with current instruments. But scientists are confident it exists because of the gravitational effects it appears to have on galaxies and galaxy clusters.
The visible universe, including Earth, the sun, other stars, and galaxies, is made of protons, neutrons, and electrons bundled together into atoms. Perhaps one of the most surprising 【discoveries】 of the 20th century was that this ordinary, or baryonic, 【matter】 makes up less than 5 percent of the mass of the universe.

67.Water security. 水安全  

Equally critical is the challenge of water security. The UN Environment Program, UNEP, has pointed out that about one-third of the world's population lives in countries with moderate to high water stress, with a 【disproportionate】 impact on the poor.
With current projected global population growth, the task of providing water for human 【sustenance】 will become increasingly difficult.
And increasing competition over this scarce but vital resource may fuel instability and conflict within states as well as between states.
The UN is doing a great deal in both areas to proactively foster 【collaboration】 among Member States.
UNEP has long been actively addressing the water issue together with partner UN 【agencies】 and other organisations. Looking ahead, the UN can do more to build synergies of technology, policy and capacity in this field. In this regard, events like the annual World Water Week in Stockholm come to the forefront of the public mind when talking about 【championing】 water issues.

68.Headmaster. 校长  

David Lynch is professor and head of education at Charles Darwin University. 【Prior】 to this, he was sub-dean in the Faculty of Education and Creative Arts at Central Queensland University and foundation head of the University's Noosa 【campus】. David's career in education began as a primary school teacher in Queensland in the early 1980's and 【progressed】 to four principal positions before 【entering】 higher education. David's research interests predominate in teacher education with particular interest in building teacher 【capability】 to meet a changed world.

69.Allergies. 过敏  

What Are Allergies?
Allergies are abnormal immune system reactions to things that are typically harmless to most people. When you're allergic to something, your immune system 【mistakenly】 believes that this substance is harmful to your body. Substances that cause allergic reactions, such as certain foods, dust, plant pollen, or medicines, are known as allergens.
In an attempt to 【protect】 the body, the immune system produces IgE antibodies to that allergen. Those antibodies then cause certain cells in the body to 【release】 chemicals into the bloodstream, one of which is histamine.
The histamine then 【acts】 on the eyes, nose, throat, lungs, skin, or gastrointestinal tract and causes the symptoms of the allergic reaction. Future exposure to that same allergen will trigger this 【antibody】 response again. This means that every time you come into contact with that allergen, you'll have some form of allergy symptoms.

70.Non-attendance. 缺勤  

In reality, however, the causes of truancy and non-attendance are diverse and multifaceted. There are as many 【triggers】 of non-attendance as there are non-attenders. Each child has her own 【unique】 story, and whilst there may often be certain identifiable factors in common, each non-attending child demands and 【deserves】 an individual response, tailored to meet her individual needs. This applies 【equally】 to the 14-year-old who fails to attend school because a parent is terminally ill, the overweight 11-year-old who fails to attend because he is 【embarrassed】 about changing for PE in front of peers, the 15-year-old who is' bored' by lessons, and to the seven-year-old who is teased in the playground because she does not wear the latest designer-label clothes.

71.Leadership. 领导力  

Leadership is all about being granted permission by others to lead their thinking. It is a bestowed moral authority that gives the right to organise and direct the efforts of others. But moral authority does not come from simply managing people effectively or communicating better or being able to motivate. It comes from many 【sources】, including being authentic and genuine, having integrity, and showing a real and deep understanding of the business in question. All these 【factors】 build confidence.
Leaders lose moral authority for three reasons: they behave 【unethically】; they become plagued by self-doubt and lose their conviction, or they are blinded by power, lose self-awareness and thus lose 【connection】 with those they lead as the context around them changes.
Having said all this, it has to be assumed that if someone becomes a leader, at some point they understood the difference between right and wrong. It is up to them to 【abide】 by a moral code and up to us to ensure that the moment we suspect they do not, we fire them or vote them out.

72.Legal deposit. 法定寄存  

Legal deposit has existed in English law since 1662. It helps to ensure that the nation's published output, and thereby its 【intellectual】 record and future published heritage, is collected systematically, to 【preserve】 the material for the use of future generations and to make it available for 【readers】 within the designated legal deposit libraries.
The Legal Deposit Libraries are the British Library, the National Library of Scotland, the National Library of Wales, the Bodleian Libraries, Oxford and the University Library, Cambridge. The legal deposit system also has 【benefits】 for authors and publishers: Deposited publications are made available to users of the deposit libraries on their premises, are preserved for the benefit of future generations, and become part of the nation's heritage. Publications are recorded in the online catalogues and become an essential 【research】 resource for generations to come.

73.Bronze vs Silver. 青铜与白银  

In an often-cited study about counterfactuals, Medvec, Madey, and Gilovich found that bronze medalists appeared happier than silver medalists in television coverage of the 1992 Summer Olympics. Medvec et al. 【argued】 that bronze medalists compared themselves to 4th place finishers, 【whereas】 silver medalists compared themselves to gold medalists. These counterfactuals were the most 【salient】 because they were either qualitatively different, gold vs silver, or categorically different, medal vs no medal, from what 【actually】 occurred. Drawing on archival data and experimental studies, we show that Olympic athletes, among others, are more likely to make counterfactual comparisons based on their 【prior】 expectations, consistent with decision affect theory. Silver medalists are more likely to be disappointed because their personal expectations are higher than 【those】 of bronze medalists. We provide a test between expectancy-based versus category-based processing and discuss circumstances that trigger each type of processing.

74.Arbitration. 仲裁  

Arbitration is a method of conflict resolution which, with more or less formalised mechanisms, occurs in many political and legal spheres. There are two main 【characteristics】 to arbitration. The first is that it is a voluntary process under which two parties in conflict agree between themselves to be 【bound】 by the judgement of a third party which has no other authority over them; the judgement, 【however】, is not legally binding. The second is that there is usually no clear body of 【law】 or set of rules that must apply; the arbitrator is free, 【subject】 to any prior agreement with the conflicting parties, to decide on whatever basis of justice is deemed 【suitable】.

75.Southern cone. 南锥体地区  

In the southern cone especially, from Venezuela to Argentina, the region is rising to overthrow the legacy of external domination of the past centuries and the cruel and destructive social forms that they have helped to establish. The 【mechanisms】 of imperial control, violence and economic warfare, hardly a distant memory in Latin America, are losing their effectiveness, a sign of the shift toward independence. Washington is now compelled to tolerate governments that in the past would have drawn intervention or reprisal. Throughout the region a vibrant 【array】 of popular movements provides the basis for a meaningful democracy. The indigenous populations, as if in a rediscovery of their pre-Columbian legacy, are much more active and influential, particularly in Bolivia and Ecuador. These developments are in part the result of a 【phenomenon】 that has been observed for some years in Latin America: As the elected governments become more formally democratic, citizens 【express】 an increasing disillusionment with democratic institutions. They have sought to construct democratic systems based on popular participation rather than elite and foreign 【domination】.

76.Joseph Engelberger. 约瑟夫·恩格尔伯格  

Joseph Engelberger, a pioneer in industrial robotics, once remarked"l can't 【define】 a robot, but I know one when I see one." If you consider all the different machines people 【call】 robots, you can see that it's nearly impossible to come up with a 【comprehensive】 definition. Everybody has a different 【idea】 of what constitutes a robot.

77.Conservationists. 环保主义者  

Conservationists have long debated whether the koala should go on the Australian national threatened species list. 【While】 the koala is clearly in trouble in some parts of the country- in Queensland, for example, high numbers 【are afflicted】 by disease- in other parts such as Victoria and South Australia the problem is not that koala populations 【are falling】, but that they have grown to the point where they are almost too numerous. For a species to be classed as vulnerable, its population 【must have decreased】 by more than 30 percent over the last three generations or 10 years. The problem is that when such a stipulation is applied to koalas, the Victorian boom offsets the Queensland bust, and the species stays off the list. This has repercussions because northern koalas are different to southern ones. They are smaller, for example, and they contain a genetic 【variation】 not represented in the South. 【For this reason】, a split listing has been devised koalas from New South Wales, the ACT and Queensland are now officially' Vulnerable'; those from Victoria and South Australia are not considered threatened.

78.Expedition. 远征  

This summer, 41 UBC alumni and friends participated in 【expeditions】 to the Canadian Arctic and the legendary Northwest Passage. Presentations, conversations and learning accompanied their exploration of the great 【outdoors】 aboard the Russian-flagged Akademik Ioffe, designed and built in Finland as a scientific research vessel in 1989. Her bridge was open to passengers virtually 24 hours a day. Experts on 【board】 presented on topics including climate change, wildlife, Inuit culture and history, and early European explorers. UBC professor Michael Byers presented on the issue of Arctic sovereignty, a 【growing】 cause of debate as ice melts, new shipping routes open, and natural resources 【become】 accessible. Recommended pre-trip reading was late UBC alumnus Pierre Bertons book, The Arctic Grail.

79.Surgery. 外科手术  

Before effective anaesthetics, surgery was very crude and very painful. Before 1800, alcohol and opium had 【little】 success in easing pain during operations. Laughing gas was used in 1844 in dentistry in the USA, but failed to ease all pain and patients 【remained】 conscious. Ether, used from 1846, made patients totally unconscious and 【lasted】 a long time. However, it could make patients cough during operations and sick afterwards. It was highly flammable and was 【transported】 in heavy glass bottles. Chloroform, used from 1847, was very effective with few side effects. However, it was difficult to get the dose right and could kill some people 【because of】 the effect on their heart. An inhaler helped to regulate the dosage.

80.Bee. 蜜蜂  

According to a research conducted by Cambridge University, flowers can find their own ways to attract insects to help them pollinate. Flowers will release an 【irresistible】 smell. Beverley Glover from the University of Cambridge and her 【colleagues】 did an experiment in which they use fake flowers to attract bees and insects. In their experiments, they freed many bumblebees from their 【origins】 repeatedly and got the same 【result】.

81.Interdisciplinary center. 跨学科中心  

A new interdisciplinary center for the study of the frontiers of the universe, from the tiniest subatomic particle to the largest chain of galaxies, has been formed at The University of Texas at Austin. The Texas Cosmology Center will be a way for the university's departments of Astronomy and Physics to 【collaborate】 on research that concerns them both."This center will bring the two departments together in an area where they 【overlap】 in the physics of the very early universe," said Dr. Neal Evans, Astronomy Department chair. Astronomical observations have 【revealed】 the presence of dark matter and dark energy, discoveries that challenge our knowledge of fundamental physics. And today's leading theories in physics involve energies so high that no Earth-bound particle accelerator can test them. They need the universe as their 【laboratory】. Dr. Steven Weinberg, Nobel laureate and professor of physics at the university, called the Center's 【advent】"a very exciting development" for that department.

82.Sales Jobs. 销售工作  

Sales jobs allow for a 【great】 deal of discretionary time and effort on the part of the sales representatives, especially when compared with managerial, manufacturing, and service jobs. Most sales representatives work independently and outside the immediate presence of their sales managers. Therefore, some form of goals needs to be in place 【to motivate and guide】 their performance. Sales personnel are not the only professionals with performance goals or quotas. Health care professionals operating in clinics have daily, weekly, and monthly goals in terms of patient visits. Service personnel are assigned a number of service calls they 【must perform】 during a set time period. Production workers in manufacturing have output goals. So, why are achieving sales goals or quotas such a big deal? The answer to this question can be found by examining how a firm's other departments are affected by how well the company's salespeople achieve their performance goals. The success of the business 【hinges on】 the successful sales of its products and services. Consider all the planning, the financial, production and marketing efforts that go into 【producing what】 the sales force sells. Everyone depends on the sales force to sell the company's products and services and they eagerly anticipate knowing things are going.
