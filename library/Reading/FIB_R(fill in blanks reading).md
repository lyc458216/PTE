**Comments: There is only a paragraph, but not include title.

1.Houston. 休斯顿

Houston is the fifth-largest metropolitan area in the United States and has an outsized 【impact】 on the U. S. economy. More than 90 percent of U. S. offshore oil and gas 【production】 takes place in the Texas Gulf Coast area, and the Houston region contains the largest 【concentration】 of energy, petrochemical, and refining industries in the United States. Houston is home to 25 percent of the country's petroleum refining capability, 40 percent of the nation's capacity for downstream chemical production, and the fastest-growing liquefied natural gas industry in the nation.

1.Monitoring Animals. 监测动物  

Monitoring animals is hard work. Field biologists have to follow 【tracks】 made by the animals and 【look】 out for fruit that they might like in order to find the animals, whether it be walking through rivers, up and down slippery hillsides with 【dense】 vegetation or through thick mud and swamps.

2.Law and Order. 法律和秩序  

The narrative of law and order is located fundamentally at the level of individual guilt and responsibility. Criminal acts are seen as individual issues of personal responsibility and 【culpability】, to which the state responds by way of policing, 【prosecution】, adjudication and punishment. This is but one level at which crime and criminal justice can be analysed. The problem is that so often analysis ends there, at the level of individual action, 【characterised】 in terms of responsibility, guilt, evil. In few other areas of social life does individualism have this hold. To take but one 【instance】, it would be absurd to restrict analysis of obesity to individual greed. It should similarly be widely seen as absurd to restrict analysis of criminal justice issues to the culpability of individuals.

3.Wrist Watch. 腕表  

The wrist watch works by 【tracking】 information such as a person's pulse or movement. When it 【detects】 a change in a person's health, the watch sends information to a touchscreen hub 【located】 in the home. The hub then 【alerts】 pre-determined contacts and calls for help immediately.

4.Blue sky. 蓝天  

The theme of contrast evident in Blue Skies is typical of Ms Vu's work. She explores organic structures using the newest technologies. She is inspired by 【minute】 detail but often works on a large scale. Her sculptures are 【ambiguous】, yet familiar, blurring the boundaries between the real and the artificial. Organic structures and spirals are the starting point for my creative exploration. Butmy work extends these concepts to explore the 【overlap】 between the real and the artificial, and how we often don't differentiate between the two,' Ms Vu said.

5.Brands. 品牌  

A brand consists of all the features that 【distinguish】 the goods and services of one seller from another: name, term, design, style, symbols, customer touch points, etc. Together, all 【elements】 of the brand work as a psychological trigger or 【stimulus】 that causes an association to all other thoughts one has had about this brand.

6.Tidal Energy. 潮汐能  

The Australian Maritime College at the University of Tasmania, in 【partnership】 with CSIRO and University of Queensland, have been awarded 2. 49 million in 【support】 for their new project that is set to attract and underpin investment in tidal energy in Australia. The project hopes to overcome barriers to investment in commercial- scale tidal farms in Australia by mapping the country's tidal energy in more 【detail】 than ever before.

7.Mercury. 水星/汞  

Mercury is not found in many common products that we buy because it can be very dangerous. The most common products that 【contain】 mercury are batteries, powerful outdoor lights, disinfectants and thermometers, which are used to measure our body's temperature. It can also be found in barometers, which are used to measure air pressure and 【show】 changes in weather, and thermostats, which 【regulate】 the temperature of buildings, Mercury can also be found in printer and photocopy toners.

8.The Hancock Building Artwork. 汉考克大厦艺术品  

Hancock Building, certainly 【lives】 up to its name. The 【title】 is derived from the Latin word "lucere", meaning "to shine", and the artwork's 3, 115 lights 【depict】 a scale map of the stars that shine in the night sky. The 13- foot art work 【contains】 thousands of glass bulbs, all fed light through blue illuminating fibre- optic lines. The sculpture, created by English artist Wolfgang Buttress with the help of astrophysicist Dr. Daniel Bayliss, represents a 3 D map of all the stars in the Northern Hemisphere that are able visible with the naked eye.

9.Maya. 玛雅文明/玛雅人  

The Classic Era of Mayan 【civilization】 came to an end around 900 AD. Why this happened is unclear; the cities were probably over- farming the land, so that a 【period】 of drought led to famine. Recent geological 【research】 supports this, as there appears to have been a 200- year drought around this time.

10.Philosophy. 哲学  

The philosophy of mind is a certain area of 【problems】 commonly recognised by English- speaking philosophers. But it is not an accident that this 【expression】 is hard to translate into other languages. This is only partly due to the fact that the English word"mind" has no exact 【equivalent】 in the other main European languages. It is also a reflection of the fact that the classification in which this label figures is itself based on certain profound philosophical assumptions, often unexpressed.

11.Talking. 交谈  

Talking is not just an activity of the vocal 【cords】, it is a way of connecting with ourselves and 【others】 that creates a culture of health and 【well-being】. Specifically, speaking with healthcare 【practitioners】 about health worries, and more generally opening up to create more and stronger social 【ties】, can have many positive benefits.

12.Tree and City. 树木与城市  

A new report by environmental 【nonprofit】 The Nature Conservancy lays out how trees could pave the way to cleaner air and cooler cities. Using 【geospatial】 information on forest cover paired with air pollution data and population 【forecasts】 for 245 cities, researchers found that trees have the biggest health 【payoffs】 in densely populated, polluted cities like Delhi, Karachi and Dhaka. The Conservancy and the C 40 Cities Climate Leadership Group presented the findings of their global survey this week at the American Public Health Association meeting in Denver, Colorado.

13.City Design. 城市设计  

The way we design our cities needs a serious rethink. After thousands of years of progress in urban development, we 【plateaued】 some 60 years ago. Cities are not safer, healthier, more efficient, or more 【equitable】. They are getting worse on these measures. The statistics on chronic disease, rising road tolls and congestion in our urban environments paint a 【bleak】 future. The clues to why lie in how we think about and design our cities.

14.An Artist's Life. 艺术家的生活  

The 【closing】 decades of an artist' s life do not generally make the biographer' s heart beat faster, but Claude Monet is one of a handful of painters who bucks the pattern of an 【irrelevant】 old age. While it' s true that by the time he was 73 he had 【accumulated】 all the usual dragging baggage- outhouses full of fancy cars, a taste for expensive wine and a sprawl of dependents- it was also now that he produced career- defining work.

15.Chapters. 章节  

Most chapters have a mixed exercise after the 【main】 work of the chapter has been completed. This will help you 【revise】 what you have done, either when you have finished the chapter or at a later date. All chapters 【end】 with some mathematical puzzles and practical investigational work. For this work you are encouraged to 【share】 your ideas with others.

16.Tomato. 番茄  

The tomato is probably the most widely grown 【vegetable】 by the home gardener because of its 【food】 value, many uses, and relative ease of 【culture】. Originating in Central and South America, the tomato was domesticated in Mexico. There are many related wild species in South America."Tomati" was the name 【used】 by Native Americans.

17.Deforestation. 森林砍伐  

Deforestation can disrupt the lives of local communities, sometimes with devastating 【consequences】. Forests provide a vast array of 【resources】 to all of us, including food, wood, medicine, fresh water, and the air we breathe. Without the trees, species can disappear, the natural water balance can become disrupted and the ecosystem that supports the human population can fall 【apart】.

18.Migration. 迁徙/移民  

Migration could be described as the well- defined journey animals make to a familiar 【destination】 at specific seasons or times of the year. All species that migrate do so for a common 【purpose】, in order to survive. Migration allows them to spend their life in more than one area and thus 【avoid】 problems that can occur in one habitat, such as lack of food, shelter or exposure to harsh weather.

19.Sleep issue. 睡眠问题  

Sleep 【deprivation】 is a global issue in all the major cities around the world where the amount of sleep is 【decreasing】 over decades. Now, the decrease is growing with the 【onslaught】 of the COVID-19 pandemic. Stress plays a major role in how we sleep. People are 【meant】 to have some kind of routines, and many people lost them during the pandemic and especially during lockdowns. People woke up and went to sleep at 【odd】 times, they ate at odd times, and all of that definitely affected their biological rhythms.

20.Alpine Newt. 高山蝾螈  

The Alpine Newt is native to much of central, continental Europe and 【occurs】 up the coasts of northeast France through to Holland. But it does not 【appear】 to have been native to the British Isles. As its name 【suggests】 it can be found in montane habitats up to 2, 500 metres in altitude but it can also be abundant in lowlands, and it will use a 【variety】 of waterbodies including both shallow and deep ponds and slow flowing streams.

21.Gender Equality. 性别平等  

With the popularity of the gender equality campaign and the cultural change, the 【traditional】 roles of men as the 【earner】, and of women in which they stay at home, are 【challenged】 today.

22.Bioenergy. 生物能源  

A Graphic Introduction was put together by northern artists, who have 【interpreted】 discussions with scientists from the Supergen Bioenergy Hub in a 【series】 of striking images which imagine alternative futures and explain some of the technology 【involved】 and how it might be put into practise.

23.Quake-resistant Structures. 抗震结构  

In the past, making structures quake- resistant meant firm yet 【flexible】 materials, such as steel and wood, that bend without breaking. Later, people tried to lift a building off its foundation, and insert rubber and steel between the building and its foundation to 【reduce】 the impact of ground vibrations. The most 【recent】 designs give buildings brains as well as concrete and steel supports, called smart buildings, the structures respond like living organisms to an earthquake's vibrations. When ground shakes and the building tips forward, the computer would 【force】 the building to shift in the opposite direction. The new designs should offer even greater 【security】 to cities where earthquakes often take place.

24.Car Mechanic. 汽车修理工  

A spokesman for the project said:"A car mechanic for 【instance】 could find at a glance where a part on a certain car model is so that it can be identified and repaired. For the motorist the system could 【highlight】 accident black spots or dangers on the road." In other cases the glasses could be worn by people going on a guided tour, 【indicating】 points of interest or by people looking at panoramas where all the sites could be identified.

25.Education. 教育  

Education is generally considered to be a key factor in improving outcomes for Indigenous Australians, with many studies showing that improved 【health】 and socioeconomic status are directly 【linked】 to educational participation and achievement. There is a range of issues 【affecting】 participation in education for Indigenous Australians, including 【access】 to educational institutions, financial constraints, and community 【expectations】.

26.Spending time. 消磨时间  

It is no secret that spending time in nature is good for your mind. Studies show that even a 【stroll】 through a city park decreases 【stress】, 【sharpens】 concentration and improves long-term mental health 【outcomes】. One report found that just being near bird song improved mental well-being.

27.Study of Leadership. 领导力研究  

Based on collaborative research by Arizona's top business schools, this study of leadership and company performance uncovers the effects of leadership driven by 【profits】, cost control, and maintaining market share, versus 【leadership】 driven more by balancing employee relations and development, customer or client 【needs】, and the welfare of the greater community. Together, Mary Sully de Luque, assistant professor of Management and Research Fellow at Thunderbird School of Global Management and David Waldman, director of the Centre for Responsible Leadership at ASU's School of Global Management and Leadership, have found that maintaining a specific focus on earnings in 【decision】 making can have negative effects on how a leader is viewed.

28.Airborne diseases. 空气传播疾病  

Airborne diseases are very easily transmitted and can result in respiratory illness that can be life threatening. It's therefore no wonder that 【outbreaks】 of airborne infectious diseases are a major public health 【concern】, and that researchers are working hard to come up with technologies to provide clean air. So far, however, such technologies have had limited 【success】.

29.Higher Education Shift. 高等教育转变  

After centuries of inequality in UK higher education benefiting men, there has been a 【reversal】 over the past three decades. A lower proportion of entrants to UK higher education institutions are male than ever before and they 【make】 up less than one- half of the total. Other developed countries have 【undergone】 a similar shift. Male 【underachievement】 is not seen only in the figures for entry but also in drop- out rates and degree performance statistics.

30.Keith Haring. 凯斯·哈林（艺术家）  

Keith Haring began as an underground artist, literally. His first famous projects were pieces of 【stylized】 graffiti drawn in New York subway stations. Haring travelled from station to station, drawing with chalk and chatting with commuters about his work. These doodles helped him develop his classic style and he 【grew】 so prolific, doing up to 40 drawings a day, that it was not long before fame and a measure of fortune followed. Soon, galleries and collectors from the art establishment wanted to buy full-sized pieces by Haring. The paintings 【skyrocketed】 in price but this did not sit well with Haring's philosophy. He believed that art, or at least his art, was for everyone. Soon, Haring opened a store which he called the Pop Shop, which he hoped would attract a broad range of people. While somewhat controversial among street artists, some of whom 【accused】 Haring of' selling out', the Pop Shop changed the way people thought about the relationship between art and business.

31.Honeybees. 蜜蜂  

It sounds like something out of a science fiction movie- or nightmare: millions of honeybees 【suddenly】 dying off, their bodies never found. Scientists have 【named】 the phenomenon' Colony Collapse Disorder', but they aren't 【united】 on the reason. Theories abound as to the 【cause】 of the mass die-off, ranging from the unlikely- cellphones affecting bees' navigational abilities- to the more 【plausible】 though still debated, widespread pesticide use.

32.Sound speed. 声速  

The speed of sound, otherwise known as Mach 1, varies with temperature. At sea level on a' standard day', the temperature is 59 Fahrenheit, and Mach 1 is approximately 761 mph. As the altitude increases, the temperature and speed of sound 【both】 decrease until about 36,000- 60,000 foot range, Mach 1 is about 661 mph. Because of the 【variation】, it is possible for an aeroplane flying supersonic at high altitudes to be slower than a subsonic flight at sea level. The transonic band, the' sound barrier' extends 【from】 around Mach 0.8- when the first supersonic shock waves form on the wing- to Mach 1.2, when the entire wing has gone supersonic.

33.Program. 程序/项目  

Our programme will develop your 【theoretical】 knowledge of Computer Science and your problem-solving and 【analytical】 skills, while enabling you to achieve the 【ultimate】 qualification for the IT professional. The programme structure is extremely 【flexible】, enabling you to personalise your MSc through a wide range of electives.

34.Sheepdog. 牧羊犬  

Considered highly intelligent, 【extremely】 energetic, acrobatic and athletic, they frequently 【compete】 with great success in sheepdog trials and dog sports. They are often 【cited】 as the most intelligent of all domestic dogs. Border Collies continue to be employed in their traditional work of 【herding】 livestock throughout the world.

35.Dictionary. 词典  

Samuel Johnson's Dictionary of the English Language is one of the most famous dictionaries in history. First published in 1755, the dictionary took just over eight years to compile, 【required】 six helpers and listed 40, 000 words. Each word was defined in detail, the definitions illustrated with quotations 【covering】 every branch of learning. It was a huge scholarly 【achievement】, a more extensive and complex dictionary than any of its predecessors- the comparable French Dictionnaire had taken 55 years to compile and required the dedication of 40 scholars.

36.Exoplanets. 系外行星  

Giant exoplanets, like the so-called' hot Jupiters' that are similar in 【characteristics】 to the solar system's biggest 【planet】 and orbit very close to their host stars, are excellent targets for 【astronomers】 in their search for their extrasolar worlds. The size and proximity of these planets are easy to 【detect】 as they create a large decrease in brightness when passing in front of their parent stars.

37.Studying law. 法律学习  

It is important to 【emphasise】 the need for hard work as an essential part of studying law, because far too many students are tempted to think that they can succeed by relying on what they imagine to be their natural ability, without bothering to add the 【expenditure】 of effort. To take an analogy some people prefer the more or less instant 【gratification】 which comes from watching television adaptation of a classic novel to the rather more 【laborious】 process of reading the novel itself. Those who 【prefer】 watching television to reading the book are less likely to study law successfully, unless they rapidly acquire a 【taste】 for text-based materials.

38.World Shakespeare Congress. 世界莎士比亚大会  

Over 800 Shakespeare scholars from almost fifty countries will gather at King's College London next week as the university co-hosts the 10 th World Shakespeare Congress to explore and honour the Bard's life and work. Organised by the International Shakespeare Association, ISA, the World Congress 【is】 held every five years and 2016 is the first time it will be co-hosted 【in】 two locations that were integral to both the personal and working life of William Shakespeare. Delegates will arrive in London on Thursday following the start of the Congress on Sunday in Stratford-upon-Avon. 【With】 a main theme of' Creating and Recreating Shakespeare', the Congress will look 【at】 the continuing global relevance of Shakespeare's work through a varied programme of plenaries, panels, seminars and workshops.

39.Private school. 私立学校  

Private schools in the UK are redoubling their marketing efforts to foreigners. Almost a third of the 68,000 boarding pupils at such schools 【already】 come from overseas. But now, with many UK residents 【unwilling】 or unable to afford the fees and a cultural 【shift】 away from boarding, many schools are looking abroad to survive. Overseas students now 【account】 for about 500 m pounds of fee income a year for boarding schools in the UK.

40.Research. 研究  

Research is a process of investigation leading to new 【insights】 effectively shared and is central to the 【purpose】 of any university. Students have the right to be taught by acknowledged 【experts】 in their field, which requires that staff members operate at the most advanced level appropriate to their 【discipline】 and level. Research is, therefore, crucial to a 【positive】 student experience from further education to doctoral development.

41.Botswana. 博茨瓦纳  

Although Botswana is rich in diamonds, it has high unemployment and stratified socioeconomic classes. In 1999, the nation 【suffered】 its first budget deficit in 16 years 【because】 of a slump in the international diamond market. Yet Botswana 【remains】 one of the wealthiest and most stable countries on the African 【continent】.

42.Shrimp farm. 虾养殖场  

【Over】 the past two decades around a third of the world's mangrove swamps have been 【converted】 for human use, with many turned into valuable shrimp farms. In 2007 an economic study of such shrimp farms in Thailand showed that the commercial profits per hectare were 9,632 dollars. If that were the only 【factor】, conversion would seem an excellent idea. However, proper 【accounting】 shows that for each hectare government subsidies formed 8,412 dollars of this figure and there were costs, too: 1,000 dollars for pollution and 12,392 dollars for losses to ecosystem services. These comprised damage to the supply of foods and medicines that people had taken from the forest, the loss of habitats for fish, and less buffering against storms. And because a given shrimp farm only stays 【productive】 for three or four years, there was the additional cost of restoring them afterwards.

43.Dances. 舞蹈  

Dance has played an important role in many musicals. In some 【cases】, dance numbers are included as an excuse to add to the colour and spectacle of the show, but dance is more effective when it forms an integral part of the 【plot】. An early example is Richard Rodgers On Your Toes, 1936, in which the story about classical ballet meeting the world of jazz enabled dance to be introduced in a way that 【enhances】, rather than interrupts the drama.

44.Conflicts. 冲突  

Most of us are 【scared】 of open conflict and avoid it if we can. And there is a 【risk】 to expressing and working through conflict. If the working involves harsh words and name-calling, people feel deeply hurt and relationships can be 【damaged】. Some group members may be afraid that if they really 【express】 their anger, they may go out of control and become violent, or they may do this. These fears can be very 【real】 and based on experience.

45.Genetically modified corn. 转基因玉米  

Almost no one regards corn with suspicion. But the 【same】 can't be said for humans' ingenious ability to engineer the plants we eat. Genetically modified, GM, crops are viewed with 【such】 hostility that they are barely grown in Europe. However, a new study by an independent group of scientists, who have done the most comprehensive 【review】 of the evidence so far, shows that our aversion to GM food is pointless, 【unscientific】 and harmful to farmers.

46.Next task. 下一项任务  

Having tracked down research that is 【relevant】 to your area of interest, the next task is to actually make 【sense】 of that research. This section is intended to show you how to be critical of the research you are 【reviewing】 and how to check that the 【evidence】 is credible and represented appropriately. Unfortunately, this means discussing the ways in which research findings may be misrepresented.

47.Britain's past. 英国历史  

The transitions which occurred in Britain around 100 BC, and after 43 AD, when the Roman Army 【invaded】 Britain, represent the key points of socio-economic trend in Britain's past. During the first century BC, the traditional communal form of life 【shifted】 rapidly to a world where certain individuals become more important. During the first century AD, Britain 【became】 fully a part of the Roman Empire.

48.Power station. 发电站  

The ruins of the South Fremantle Power Station have stood empty since 1985, home only to urban explorers and street 【artists】. Opened in 1951, the power station was once a pillar of progress for the expanding energy 【demands】 of Perth. Here is stood proud and strong for 34 years, supplying energy to its surrounding metropolis until 1985 when it was deemed to no longer be worth the 【money】. The doors were shuttered, and the plant's four tall chimney stacks were demolished, leaving the rest of the plant to rot by the sea.

49.John Milton. 约翰·弥尔顿（诗人）  

John Milton wrote in a wide range of genres, in 【several】 languages, and on an extraordinary range of subjects. His was a more general 【education】 than is offered at Cambridge these days, and it continued after his seven years here, equipping him with the tools to write some of the most 【groundbreaking】 literature ever seen, and to engage as a polemicist on many different social, political, and theological 【questions】.

50.Fossil fuels. 化石燃料  

But look beyond fossil fuels for the most intriguing trends. One is that the energy intensity of the world economy, the amount of energy it takes to produce one dollar's worth of 【income】, keeps falling, at a rate of about 2 percent. What this means is that even without any change in the 【relative】 shares of fossil-based and fossil-free sources in the world's energy mix, we could have 2 percent annual economic growth without increasing carbon emissions from energy use. Of course that is not enough to 【address】 climate change and we need more economic growth than that. It is 【nonetheless】 a stunning number, which refutes the claim by some environmentalists that permanent economic growth is fundamentally incompatible 【with】 finite physical resources.

51.Active learning classrooms. 主动学习教室  

Active learning classrooms, ALCs, are student-centered, technology-rich classrooms. They are easily identified with their large 【circular】 tables and movable seating designed to improve student 【engagement】 in class. Typically, each table is accompanied by a whiteboard and flat-screen monitor to display student work and larger rooms frequently have miniature bulb and microphones and at each table. In this way, students are able to 【signal】 if they have questions or want to speak to the 【entire】 room. ALCs provide the hands-on environment that has transformed old class from passive 【lecture】 to very active group design work.

52.Carbon prices. 碳价格  

Carbon prices in the European Union also reached their highest level in a decade this summer following a series of 【reforms】 meant to limit the oversupply of 【credits】 and expand many industries subjected to the cap. The biggest development of all may be in China, the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter, which has taken steps toward its own 【emissions】 trading programme. China's move has the 【potential】 to narrow the gap between global carbon prices and climate costs to 63 percent in the early 2020s, OECD found.

53.Plasmonic materials. 等离子体材料  

One of the best-studied applications of plasmonic materials is sensors for 【detecting】 chemical and biological agents. In one approach, researchers coat a plasmonic nanomaterial with a substance that 【binds】 to a molecule of interest, say, a bacterial toxin. In the absence of the toxin, light shining on the material is 【reemitted】 at a specific angle. But if the toxin is present, it will alter the frequency of the surface plasmon and, thus consequently, the angle of the reflected light. This effect can be measured with great accuracy, 【enabling】 to even trace amounts of the toxin.

54.London Zoo. 伦敦动物园  

It was a busy old time at London Zoo this week, reports the Daily Mail, where over 19, 000 animals were having their annual weight and height 【checked】. Some creatures, such as rhinos, tigers, and okapis, had to be 【coaxed】 on to specially constructed larger scales. The 【statistics】 are shared with other zoos across the world to allow keepers to compare information about 【endangered】 species. The zoological manager named Mark Habben said:"We have to know the vital statistics of each animal at the zoo, however big or small."

55.Communicating with patients. 与患者沟通  

British doctors have been 【urged】 to use simple language when communicating with their patients, says the BBC. The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges says very often correspondence contains complex medical jargon rather than plain and simple English. Using of phrase"twice daily" to explain the 【dosing】 of a medicine is better than Latin abbreviation"bd". The Please Write to Me initiative is aimed basically at doctors working in 【outpatient】 clinics, although it is the best practise for all clinicians who need to write clinical letters and they are being asked to write directly to patients, rather than sending them a copy of a letter 【penned】 to their GP. The Academy suggests any medical words should be 【translated】 in plain English.

56.Trees. 树木  

Trees may have a lot to teach us about being part of a 【community】 and how cooperation is better for a society than 【competition】. Scientists are only just beginning to understand how it all works, but we now know that trees growing together 【share】 all of the available resources with each other. So, 【strong】 trees in a very good position will supply food and water to weaker trees that receive less sunlight. They do this 【through】 their roots, the soil and also the networks of the tiny fungi that grow in the soil among them.

57.Paris. 巴黎  

In the preceding hundred years, Paris had been 【centre】 stage for political and social 【movements】 that had deeply affected all of Europe. The many ways in which tradition had already been challenged and 【shaken】 during those years helped make it easier for those to achieve a break with tradition art.

58.Geography. 地理学  

Many famous geographers and non-geographers have attempted to define the discipline in a few short words. The concept has also changed throughout the ages, making it difficult to create a 【concise】, universal geography definition for such a dynamic and all-encompassing subject. After all, Earth is a big place with many 【facets】 to study. It affects and is affected by the people who live there and use its 【resources】. But basically, geography is the study of the 【surface】 of Earth and the people who live there, and all that encompasses.

59.Climate change prediction. 气候变化预测  

All kinds of predictions may be about to get even more difficult 【thanks to】 climate change. Though no one is sure 【exactly】 what its effects will be, it seems that extreme weather conditions 【such as】 storms and hurricanes are 【likely to】 become more common. Such events have far reaching effects on distant weather systems, making general forecasting much harder.

60.Class participation. 课堂参与  

Because instructional methods, expected class participation and the nature of the courses vary, no fixed number of absences is applicable to all 【situations】. Each 【instructor】 is responsible for making clear to the class at the beginning of the 【semester】 his or her policies and procedures in regard to class 【attendance】 and the reasons for them.

61.Western firms. 西方企业  

What such a map would have failed to reveal, however, was the changing nature of the 【connections】 put in place by Western firms as they shifted work around the globe. It is often assumed that when Western firms, or any firm for that matter, reach out across 【borders】 to establish a factory outlet here, an assembly plant there or a subsidiary in some far-off 【location】, they do so through directly investing and thereby wholly owning such facilities. In the 1970s and 1980s, among the low-cost manufacturing overseas operations, this was indeed often the case, but increasingly Western firms started to conduct their business at-a-distance through a variety of indirect means, of which subcontracting became the principal 【arrangement】. 【Subcontracting】 is a way of putting out work to partner firms on a defined, contractual basis, where the tasks involved are specified precisely, as are the turnaround times and the quality of the finished goods. As a business arrangement, it is more flexible than owning factories overseas and more enforceable than a 【straightforward】 market exchange relationship.

62.Secondary school. 中学  

Secondary school can be a lonely place for 【adolescents】 who don't have a best friend or a group of 【trusted】 friends. Young people will be more skilled in the art of making genuine friends, and keeping them, if they know how to be 【assertive】, are optimistic about life, have some 【basic】 social skills and have a relationship with a parent or carer that includes 【honest】 talk.

63.Physical activity. 身体活动  

Participating regularly in physical activity has been shown to benefit an individual's health and 【wellbeing】. Regular physical activity is important in reducing the risk of 【chronic】 diseases, such as heart diseases and stroke, obesity, diabetes and some forms of cancer. The National Physical Activity Guidelines for Adults 【recommends】 at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity, 【preferably】 every day of the week, to 【obtain】 health benefits.

64.Medicare. 医疗保险（美国）  

It is understandable that the government would look outside of Medicare to get the efficiency-related changes it 【wants】. If Medicare was capable of delivering those 【changes】, it would have already done so. The objections to making such a move will be about the potential 【loss】 of 【jobs】 from Medicare.
Given how labor-intensive the current system is, this will be a genuine concern, but one that is facing all industries dealing with modernisation through improved technology.

65.Temperature. 温度  

Green spaces contribute significantly to a 【reduction】 of soil and aerial temperatures during spells of hot weather, so contributing to human wellbeing. In the garden 【context】, there is, however, little information as to what extent various types of plants 【differ】 in their cooling potential and how certain planting combinations may maximise cooling under a scenario of 【low】 rainfall and minimal water inputs.

66.Citizenship education. 公民教育  

Civics and citizenship education builds students' knowledge and understanding of the ways in which citizens can actively 【participate】 in Australia's diverse and inclusive society. Students learn about the civic institutions and the 【processes】 through which decisions are made for the common good of the 【community】 and they also develop the 【skills】 and understandings that relate to the organisation of a harmonious democratic society.

67.Eutrophication. 富营养化  

Eutrophication, is a process when bodies of water 【accumulate】 to a high nutrient level due to extensive fertiliser in the soil. The water becomes overly enriched with minerals and nutrients which induce excessive growth of 【algae】 and other aquatic species which may 【deplete】 minerals in the water, thus endanger other species.

68.Fossilized trackway. 化石足迹  

A fossilised trackway on public lands in Lake County, Oregon, may reveal 【clues】 about the ancient family dynamics of Columbian mammoths. Recently excavated by a 【team】 from the University of Oregon Museum of Natural and Cultural History, the Bureau of Land Management and the University of Louisiana, the trackway includes 117 footprints thought to represent a number of 【adults】 as well as juvenile and infant mammoths.

69.Global ecosystem. 全球生态系统  

Whether measured by greenhouse gas concentrations, deforestation rates or declining fish stocks, current 【unsustainable】 consumption and production patterns threatened to exceed the capacity of global ecosystems and the world community must 【accelerate】 efforts to pursue environmentally 【sound】 economic growth and, meet our commitments to future generations.

70.Radioactivity V2. 放射性V2  

So why the concern? It's partly 【because】 radioactivity is invisible. If you receive a large dose, or if you 【ingest】 radioactive heavy metals, it is certainly toxic, and we tend to 【associate】 it with cancer, a great fear in modern 【society】. Nuclear waste is also highly concentrated. While this is seen as a"problem" it can be an advantage, it is very localised and its radioactive nature, means we can detect easily, the movement of tiny amounts of material.

72.Mathematics and statistics. 数学与统计学  

Mathematics and statistics play a 【part】 in almost all daily activities. They are at the 【heart】 of advances in science and technology, as well as providing 【indispensable】 problem-solving and decision-making tools in many 【areas】 of life.

73.Electric eels. 电鳗  

Electric eels are born to shock. Thanks to cells called electrocytes which, stacked like batteries, make up 80 percent of their bodies, these cunning South American 【hunters】 can deliver debilitating blows of up to 600 volts to their prey. But they've harnessed their electricity to pack even bigger punches. Last year, Vanderbilt University biologist Kenneth Catania revealed electric eels bring their positively charged head and negatively charged 【tail】 closer together to generate a more powerful 【current】.

74.Playwright Shakespeare. 剧作家莎士比亚  

Shakespeare produced most of his 【works】 between 1589 and 1613. His early plays were comedies and histories, 【genres】 he raised to the peak of sophistication and artistry by the end of the 16th century. He then wrote tragedies until about 1608, including Hamlet, King Lear, Othello, and Macbeth, considered some of the finest 【examples】 in the English language. In his last phase, he wrote tragicomedies, also known as romances, and 【collaborated】 with other playwrights.

75.Ponzi scheme. 庞氏骗局  

Ponzi is 【infamous】. His original scheme was based on the legitimate arbitrage of international reply coupons for 【postage】 stamps, but he soon began diverting new investors' money to make 【payments】 to earlier investors as 【interest】.

76.Pupil charity. 学生慈善  

My school in the city of London held a 【charity】 competition. In the community, I was voted as the chairman. We 【raised】 48, 000 pounds and I won the first place in the end. During this period, I learnt a lot and realised the importance of 【tenacity】 and how to 【rouse】 other pupils' awareness.

77.Financial crisis. 金融危机  

Since the beginning of the financial crisis, there have been two principal 【explanations】 for why so many banks made such disastrous decisions. The first is structural. Regulators did not regulate. Institutions failed to 【function】 as they should. Rules and guidelines were either inadequate or 【ignored】. The second explanation is that Wall Street was 【incompetent】, that the traders and investors didn't know enough, that they made extravagant bets without understanding the consequences.

78.Fingermarks. 指纹痕迹  

Fingerprints, referred to as"fingermarks" in forensics, are formed when residue from the ridged skin of the fingers or palms is 【transferred】 onto a surface, leaving behind an impression. Fingermarks are often made of sweat and colourless 【contaminating】 materials such as soap, moisturiser and grease. These fingermarks are described as"latent" as they are generally invisible to the naked eye, which means that 【locating】 them at a crime scene can be challenging.

79.Lithium. 锂  

The lightest of any solid element, lithium has, until now, played a 【modest】 role in industry. Silvery in colour, and softer than lead, it has been used mainly as an alloy of aluminium, a base for automobile grease, and in the 【production】 of glass and ceramics. It is so 【unstable】 that it is never found in its pure form in nature. Lithium floats on water, or, 【rather】, it skitters wildly about, trailing a vapour cloud of hydrogen, 【until】 it dissolves.

80.Low fertility. 低生育率  

Low fertility is a concern for many OECD countries as they face the prospect of population ageing. This article makes 【comparisons】 between Australia and seven other OECD countries in fertility rates between 1970 and 2004. Changing age 【patterns】 of fertility are also compared and show that for most of the countries, women are 【postponing】 childbirth and having fewer babies. The 【associations】 of women's education levels and rates of employment with fertility are also 【explored】.

81.Iceland. 冰岛  

On average, Iceland 【experiences】 a major volcanic event once every 5 years. Since the Middle Ages, a third of all the lava that has 【covered】 the earth's surface has erupted in Iceland. However, according to a recent geological hypothesis, this estimate does not include 【submarine】 eruptions, which are much more extensive than those on the land surface.

82.Transport policy. 交通政策  

Despite transport problems being a topic of frequent dinner table conversation, comprehensive 【assessment】 of policy directions for transport has been the subject of remarkably little academic analysis. This chapter introduces the 【scope】 of the book, which is intended to help redress this 【shortcoming】. The primary focus is on 【urban】 transport policy, with the emphasis being on policy analysis rather than analysis of the policy process. Importantly, the chapter sets out some key propositions that have been important in shaping the authors' approach to the particular matters that are considered in subsequent chapters.

83.Leading scientists. 顶尖科学家  

The Life Science Institute at the University of Michigan achieves 【excellence】 in biomedical research by bringing together the world's leading scientists from a variety of life science disciplines to 【accelerate】 breakthroughs and discoveries that will improve human health. With close to 400 scientific staff members, the LSI is exploiting the power of a 【collaborative】 and interdisciplinary approach to biomedical research in an open-laboratory facility.

84.Pewter. 白镴  

Pewter is an attractive metal which has been used for the 【production】 of household and other items in Britain since Roman times. It is an alloy 【consisting】 mostly of tin which has been 【mixed】 with small amounts of other metals such as copper, lead or antimony to 【harden】 it and make it more durable.

85.McLuhan. 麦克卢汉（传播学家）  

McLuhan's preeminent theory was his idea that human history could be 【divided】 into four eras: the acoustic age, the literary age, the print age and the electronic age. He 【outlined】 the concept in a 1962 book called The Gutenberg Galaxy, which was 【released】 just as the television was starting to become popular.
He 【predicted】 the world was entering the fourth, electronic age, which would be characterized by a community of people brought together by technology.
He called it the"global village", and said it would be an age when everyone had 【access】 to the same information through technology. The"global village" could be understood to be the internet.

86.Tidal energy. 潮汐能  

The Australian Renewable Energy Agency"ARENA" has 【awarded】 2. 49 million to cover a portion of the cost of a collaborative project led by the Australian Maritime College at the University of Tasmania, in 【partnership】 with The University of Queensland and CSIRO. The 5. 85 million' Tidal Energy in Australia- Assessing Resource and Feasibility to Australia's Future Energy Mix' project will map the country's tidal energy in unprecedented detail before assessing its ability to contribute to Australia's energy needs. Lead chief investigator Associate Professor Irene Penesis from the University of Tasmania said the project would help overcome 【barriers】 to investment in commercial-scale tidal farms in Australia.' With some of the largest tides in the world, Australia is 【ideal】 for this extremely reliable and low-carbon form of energy,' she said.

87.What is music. 什么是音乐  

What is music? In one sense, this is an easy 【question】. Even the least musical among us can recognise 【pieces】 of music when we hear them and name a few canonical 【examples】. We know there are different kinds of music and, even if our 【knowledge】 of music is restricted, we know which kinds we like and which kinds we do not.

88.Durkheim. 涂尔干（社会学家）  

Durkheim found humanistic studies uninteresting, 【turning】 his attention from psychology and philosophy to ethics and eventually, sociology. He graduated with a degree in philosophy in 1882. Durkheim's views could not get him a major academic appointment in Paris, so from 1882 to 1887 he taught philosophy at several provincial schools.
In 1885 he 【left for】 Germany, where he studied sociology for two years. Durkheim's period in Germany 【resulted in】 the publication of numerous articles on German social science and philosophy, which 【gained】 recognition in France, earning him a teaching appointment at the University of Bordeaux in 1887.

89.Octopus. 章鱼  

If consciousness comes in degrees, then how far along on the spectrum is the octopus? Octopuses almost certainly feel pain. They nurse and protect 【injured】 body parts, and slow a preference not to be touched near wounds. In addition to feeling pain, octopuses also have 【sophisticated】 sensory capacities: excellent eyesight, and acute sensitivity to taste and smell. This, together with their large nervous systems and 【complex】 behaviour makes it all but certain. The question of what subjective experience might be like for an octopus is 【complicated】 by the odd relationship between its brain and body.

90.Pullman historic district. 普尔曼历史街区  

Built in 1880 on 4,000 acres of 【land】 outside of the Chicago city limits, Pullman, Illinois, was the first industrial planned 【community】 in the United States. George Pullman, of the Pullman railroad Car Company, built the south residential portion of the company town first, which contained 531 【houses】, some of which stand today more or less as they did originally.

91.The Roman people. 罗马人  

The Roman people had at first been inclined to regard the French Revolution with either indifference or 【derision】. But as the months went by and the 【emigres】 who remained in the city were less and less 【hopeful】 of an early return home, the mood of the Romans became increasingly antagonistic towards the' assassins of Paris'. The nationalisation of Church property in France, the confiscation of papal territories, the dwindling of contributions and the paucity of tourists and pilgrims all contributed to an exacerbation of this antagonism. When the French Convention, determined to gain international recognition for the Republic, dispatched envoys to Rome, the people turned upon them in fury.

92.Gauss. 高斯（数学家）  

Gauss was a child prodigy. There are many 【anecdotes】 concerning his precocity as a child, and he made his first ground-breaking mathematical 【discoveries】 while still a teenager.
At just three years old, he 【corrected】 an error in his father payroll calculations, and he was looking after his father's accounts on a regular 【basis】 by the age of 5. At the age of 7, he is reported to have amazed his teachers by summing the integers from 1 to 100 almost instantly, having quickly spotted that the sum was actually 50 pairs of numbers, with each pair summing to 101, total 5,050. By the age of 12, he was already attending gymnasium and criticising Euclid's geometry.

93.Environment of studying. 学习环境  

Some students say that they need complete quiet to read and study. Others study best in a crowded, noisy room because the noise actually 【helps】 them concentrate. Some students like quiet music playing; 【others】 do not. The point is, you should know the level of noise that is optimal for your own studying. However, one general rule for all students is that the television seems to be more of a distraction than music or other background noise, so 【leave】 the TV off when you are reading or studying. 【Also】, don't let yourself become distracted by computer games, email, or Internet surfing.

94.Psychoanalytic and behaviorist. 精神分析与行为主义  

Elements of both the psychoanalytic and behaviourist theories are 【arranged】 in modern approaches to personality. Advances in neuroscience have begun to 【bridge】 the gap between biochemistry and behaviour, but there is still a great deal that needs to be explained. Without a consistent understanding of personality, how can we begin to 【categorise】 risk takers? If we cannot, we will be unable to 【compare】 their genes with those of others.

95.Coral reef. 珊瑚礁  

Coral reefs support more marine life than any other ocean ecosystem and are, not 【surprisingly】, a favourite pursuit for many divers. But as well as being physically and biologically spectacular, coral reefs also 【support】 the livelihoods of over half a billion people. What is more, this number is expected to 【double】 in coming decades while the area of high-quality reef is expected to halve. In combination with the very real threat of climate change, which could lead to increased seawater temperatures and ocean acidification, we start to 【arrive】 at some quite frightening scenarios.

96.Well-being. 幸福感  

Life in the UK 2012 provides a unique overview of well-being in the UK today. The report is the first snapshot of 【life】 in the UK to be delivered by the Measuring National Well-being programme and will be 【updated】 and published annually. Well-being is discussed in terms of the economy, people and the environment. Information such as the unemployment rate or 【number】 of crimes against the person are presented alongside 【data】 on people's thoughts and feelings, for example, satisfaction with our jobs or 【leisure】 time and fear of crime. Together, a richer picture on' how society is doing' is provided.

97.The essence of reasoning. 推理的本质  

One of the most eminent of psychologists, Clark Hull, 【claimed】 that the essence of reasoning lies in the putting together of two' behaviour segments' in some 【novel】 way, never actually performed before, so as to reach a goal.
Two followers of Clark Hull, Howard and Tracey Kendler, 【devised】 a test for children that was explicitly based on Clark Hull's principles. The children were given the task of learning to 【operate】 a machine so as to get a toy. In order to succeed they had to go through a two-stage sequence.

98.American executive. 美国高管  

The American executive, unlike the British, has no connexion with the legislature, and this lack of 【coordination】 between executive and legislature is one of the 【distinctive】 features of American federal government. The Constitution guarded against executive control by 【disqualifying】 federal officials, whether civil or military, from membership in Congress.

99.Recruitment approaches. 招聘方法  

The six programmes represented here report that word of mouth is by far their most 【effective】 recruitment tool, particularly because it typically yields candidates who are similar to previously successful candidates. Moreover, satisfied candidates and school systems are likely to 【spread】 the word without any special 【effort】 on the part of their programme. Other, less personal advertising approaches, such as radio and television spots and local newspaper advertisements, have also proven fruitful, 【especially】 for newer programmes. New York uses a print advertising campaign to inspire dissatisfied professionals to become teachers. Subway posters send provocative 【messages】 to burned-out or disillusioned professionals."Tired of diminishing returns? Invest in NYC kids" was just one of many Madison Avenue-inspired invitations. News coverage has also proven to be a 【boon】 to alternative programmes. When the New York Times, for example, ran a story about the district's alternative route programme, 2,100 applications flooded in over the next six weeks.

100.Pre-Raphaelite. 拉斐尔前派  

Pre-Raphaelitism was Britain's most significant and influential 19th-century art movement. Founded in 1848, it 【centred】 on a group of three young artists: William Holman Hunt, Dante Gabriel Rossetti and John Everett Millais. These artists sought to revive English art by radically turning away from the old studio 【tradition】 and bringing painting into direct 【contact】 with nature. With an eye for absolute 【accuracy】, every detail was now to have intense realist as well as 【symbolic】 meaning.

101.Network. 网络  

Researchers suggest the following tips as you begin to network, seek common ground, 【engage】 with your network regularity, and consistently 【apply】 yourself to making your network work or it will wither. It is a skill that you need to 【practise】, not a talent.

102.Fingerprints. 指纹  

Fingerprints can 【prove】 that a suspect was actually at the scene of a crime. As long as a human entered a crime scene, there will be traces of DNA. DNA can help the police to 【identify】 an individual to crack a case. An institute in London can help 【preserve】 DNA and be used to match with the 【samples】 taken from the crime scenes.

103.Smart organisms. 智能生物  

Some of the most basic organisms are smarter than we thought. Rather than moving about randomly, amoebas and plankton employ sophisticated 【strategies】 to look for food and might travel in a way that 【optimises】 their foraging.
Immediately after an amoeba turned right, it was twice as likely to turn left as right again, and vice versa, they told a meeting of the American Physical Society meeting in Denver, Colorado, last week. This suggests that the cells have a rudimentary 【memory】, being able to remember the last direction they had just turned in.

104.Particle and neutron. 粒子与中子  

The electrons that 【orbit】 closest to the nucleus are strongly 【attracted】. They are called bound electrons. The electrons that are farther away from the pull of nucleus can be 【forced】 out of their orbits. These are called free electrons. Free electrons can move from one atom to another. This movement is known as electron flow. Electricity is the movement or flow of electrons from one atom to another.

105.Business etiquette. 商务礼仪  

---

106.Linguistic effects. 语言效应  

An important corollary of this focus on language as the window to legal epistemology is the central role of 【discourse】 to law and other sociocultural processes. In particular, 【the ideas that】 people hold about how language works"linguistic ideologies" combine with linguistic structuring to create powerful, often unconscious effects. In recent years, linguistic anthropologists have made much progress in developing more precisely analytic 【tools】 for tracking those effects.

107.No parents. 无父母  

For many first-year students, the University may be their first 【experience】 living away from home for an extended period of time. It is a 【definite】 break from home. The individual's usual 【sources】 of support are no longer present to 【facilitate】 adjustment to the unfamiliar environment. Here are tips for students which may provide realistic expectations concerning living arrangements and social life on campus. In addition, students may benefit from information concerning resources available to them at the Counselling Centre.

108.Lake Turkana. 图尔卡纳湖  

Lake Turkana is a large lake in Kenya, East Africa. This 【part】 of Africa was home to some of the first humans. Here, archaeologists have found piles of 【bones】"both human and animal" and collections of stones that humans used as 【tools】. By carefully uncovering and 【examining】 these remains, scientists have started to put together the story of our earliest ancestors. In 2001, a 4-million-year-old skeleton was uncovered in the area. Although a link between it and modern-day humans has not been established, the skeleton shows the species was walking upright.

109.Chimpanzees' gesture. 黑猩猩手势  

Chimpanzee posture, gestures, and facial expressions communicate many messages and 【emotions】 between various individuals. When 【greeting】 a dominant individual following an absence or in response to an aggressive gesture, nervous 【subordinates】 may approach with submissive signals, crouching, presenting the hindquarters, holding a hand out, accompanied by pant, grunts or squeaks. In response, the dominant individual may make gestures of 【reassurance】, such as touching, kissing, or embracing.

110.London's National Portrait Gallery. 伦敦国家肖像馆  

London's National Portrait Gallery is currently celebrating the fifty-year 【career】 of photographer Sandra Lousada. The twenty one portraits on display depict key figures in literature, film and fashion from the early 1960s, 【subsequent】 to the acquisition of forty portraits by Lousada, the 【display】 at the National Portrait Gallery highlights shots taken between 1960 and 1964, many of which 【feature】 in Lousada's book Public Faces Private Places 2008. Formal commissioned portraits are shown alongside behind the scenes photographs taken on films 【sets】 and unguarded portraits of sitters captured at home.

111.Musicals. 音乐剧  

One of the most popular forms of theatre is the musical. Combining drama, dance and music, the musical has been around for over a century, and in that time has kept pace with changing 【tastes】 and social 【conditions】, as well as 【advances】 in theatre technology. Many modern musicals are known for their spectacular 【sets】, lighting and other effects.

112.Hippocrates. 希波克拉底（医学之父）  

Hippocrates allowed observation, rationality and his own genuine respect for his patients to 【guide】 his practice"Garrison 94". Using the scientific method, he carefully 【recorded】 his patient's symptoms and 【responses】 to treatments, and used the data 【gathered】 to evaluate and prescribe the most successful regimens. His prestige as a great medical 【practitioner】, educator, and author helped spread these ideals of 【rational】 medicine throughout the ancient world.

113.Nutrition. 营养学  

Since nutrition scientists are constantly making new discoveries, we need to revise our 【recommendations】 for healthy eating from time to time. However, nutrition is an art as well as a 【science】. It's an art because it requires creativity to develop a healthy eating plan for people who differ in their food preferences, beliefs and culture, let alone in their nutritional needs according to their genes and life stage. As we discover more about how our genes and our environment 【interact】, it's becoming increasingly difficult to provide a single set of dietary recommendations that will be 【suitable】 for everyone.

114.Antarctic. 南极  

At the height of summer the Antarctic, tourist ships move gently around the coast. Even 30 years ago such sights would have been unthinkable, but today people are willing to pay large sums of money to see the last real wilderness in the world. In the Arctic, careless human exploitation in the 【past】 has damaged the fragile ecosystem. Today concerned governments are trying to find ways to develop the region 【while】 caring for the very special natural environment. 【Because】 the Antarctic is less accessible AC than the Arctic, it is still largely undamaged by humans, although holes in the ozoneAClayer above the Antarctic have already been discovered. Many people believe that one way to preserve the area is to make the whole region into a world park, with every form of exploitation internationally 【banned】.

115.Critical thinking. 批判性思维  

Critical thinking involves looking at something you may have seen many times and examining it from many different 【angles】 and perspectives. It involves going beyond the 【obvious】 or beyond"easy" to seek new understanding and rare 【solutions】. It involves looking at common issues with uncommon eyes, known problems with new scepticism, everyday conflicts with probing 【curiosity】, and daily challenges with greater attention to detail.

116.Accounting and finance. 会计与金融  

While accounting focuses on the day-to-day management of financial 【reports】 and records across the business world, finance uses this same information to project future growth and to 【analyse】 expenditure in order to strategize company finances. By studying this major you get to have a better insight on the market, with the right 【knowledge】 and skills acquired you should be able than when you graduate to advise others in making strong investments. This major will help you gain responsibility of predicting and 【analysing】 the potential for profit and growth, assessing monetary resources, utilising accounting statistics and reports, and also looking externally for future funding options.

117.New ideas. 新想法  

First, new ideas are the 【wheels】 of progress. Without them, stagnation 【reigns】. Whether you're a designer dreaming of another world, an 【engineer】 working on a new kind of structure, an 【executive】 charged with developing a fresh business concept, an advertiser seeking a breakthrough way to sell your product, a fifth-grade teacher trying to plan a memorable school 【assembly】 programme, or a volunteer looking for a new way to sell the same old raffle tickets, your ability to 【generate】 good ideas is critical to your success.

118.Population growth. 人口增长  

For two decades, leading up to the millennium, global demand for food 【increased】 steadily, along with growth in the world's population, record harvests, 【improvements】 in incomes, and the diversification of diets. As a result, food 【prices】 continued to 【decline】 through 2000. But beginning in 2004, prices for most grains began to rise. Although there was an increase in production, the increase in demand was 【greater】.

119.The nature of human. 人性本质  

Modern developments in areas such as neuroscience, artificial intelligence and evolutionary psychology have resulted in new 【ways】 of thinking about human nature. Can we explain the mind and consciousness in 【terms】 of brain function? Can we understand modern human behaviour in terms of our evolutionary heritage? Is science even the right 【place】 to start if we want to understand human nature? Come along the Great Debate, hear the arguments and have your 【say】.

120.Education and well-being. 教育与幸福感  

Education and well-being have often been 【associated】. The idea that education can promote individual well-being indirectly, by 【improving】 earnings and promoting 【social】 mobility, is an old one; so are notions of education helping to promote the good society by 【contributing】 to economic growth and equality of opportunity.

121.Breton language. 布列塔尼语  

It is difficult to tell precisely when the Breton language was born. As early as the VIth century the new country was 【established】 and known as"Lesser Britain", but for many centuries its language 【remained】 close to the one of Great Britain, very close even to the dialect spoken in the South West. The VIIIth century is the milestone where Breton, Cornish and Welsh are 【considered】 as different languages.

122.Cheat. 作弊  

Although not written about extensively, a few individuals have considered the concept and act of cheating in 【history】 as well as contemporary culture. J. Barton Bowyer writes that cheating"is the advantageous distortion of perceived reality. The advantage falls to the cheater because the cheated person 【misperceives】 what is assumed to be the real world". The cheater is taking advantage of a person, a situation, or 【both】. Cheating also involves the"distortion of perceived reality" or what others call"deception". Deception can involve hiding the"true" reality or"showing" reality in a way intended to deceive others.

123.Ice storm. 冰暴  

An ice storm is a type of 【weather】 when cold rainfall comes down into the 【cold】 air and the water turned into 【ice】. Once there were 【more】 than 16, 000 households had a blackout 【during】 an ice storm as the ice storm would smash the cables.

124.Investment. 投资  

To invest, you need to 【draw up】 a clear plan, do your own research, 【build in】 a margin of safety by always thinking about the valuation and, 【ultimately】, be patient. By all means include some speculative picks if you wish, but ensure they are only a small part of your portfolio. Looking for an oil explorer whose shares 【double】, treble and double again is exciting but such firms are very rare. There are a lot more which have a consistent record of paying out the 【dividends】 which really make the markets work for you, once they are reinvested.

125.Coastal fish farms. 沿海养鱼场  

Coastal fish farms seem to do less harm to nearby plants and animals than previously believed, a new study 【reveals】. And marine ecosystems can 【recover】 from this damage 【surprisingly】 fast. But the analysis of a single trout farm in a Faroe Islands fjord over nearly a year also shows that these facilities need to be 【placed】 carefully, and that there's a limit to how many can operate in a particular area before its biodiversity suffers lasting harm. In coastal farms, fish live in large cages hanging from pontoons on the surface. Fish faeces and uneaten food sink to the seabed, affecting its ecosystem. Badly-managed farms can also have serious effects on the surrounding water column.

126.Gallery of Canada. 加拿大画廊  

An exhibit that brings together for the first 【time】 landscapes painted by French impressionist Pierre-Auguste Renoir 【comes】 to the National Gallery of Canada this June.
The 【gallery】 in Ottawa worked with the National Gallery of London and the Philadelphia Museum of Art to 【pull】 together the collection of 60 Renoir 【paintings】 from 45 public and private collections.

127.Environmental Policy. 环境政策  

Thus, the environmental policy does not contribute to profitability in any real sense at all. In practise, it is companies that are well-organized and 【efficient】, or that are already comfortably profitable, that have time to 【establish】 and police environmental policies. This is confusing the cause with effect. It is not that environmental best 【practice】 causes profitablility, but that being profitable allows for 【concern】 for the environment.

128.Climate. 气候  

Climate is the word we 【use】 for weather over a long period of time. The desert has a 【dry】 climate because there 【is】 very little rain. The UK 【has】 a temperate climate, which means winters are overall mild and summers generally don't get too hot.

129.SISU. 西苏（芬兰语：毅力）  

Upholding the motto of"Integrity, Vision and Academic Excellence" Shanghai International Studies University"SISU" is an internationally recognised, 【prestigious】 academic institution distinctive for its multidisciplinary and multicultural nature, committed to preparing innovative professionals and future global leaders for a wide range of international expertise to address the critical challenges of our times.
Drawing on our strengths in multi-language programmes and multi-disciplinary resources, while responding to national and regional strategies, we operate more than 70 research institutes and centre serving as academic think tanks to provide advisory services on language policies, diplomatic strategies and global public 【opinion】 of China.
These academic entities have contributed landmark research and are also dedicated to promoting the development of social sciences in China. We have now 【established】 partnerships with more than 330 universities and institutions from 56 countries and regions, and have 【maintained】 close connexion with international organisations, including the United Nations and the European Union.

130.Crime prevention. 犯罪预防  

Crime prevention has a long history in Australia, and in other parts of the world. In all societies, people have tried to 【protect】 themselves and those close to them from assaults and other abuses. Every time someone locks the door to their house or their car, they practise a form of prevention. Most parents want their children to learn to be law abiding and not spend extended periods of their lives in prison. In this country, at east, most succeed. Only a small minority of young people become 【recidivist】 offenders. In a functioning society, crime prevention is part of everyday life. While prevention can be 【all-pervasive】 at the grassroots, it is oddly neglected in mass media and political discourses. When politicians, talkback radio hosts and newspaper editorialists pontificate about crime and 【possible】 remedies, it is comparatively rare for them to 【mention】 prevention. Overwhelmingly, emphasis is on policing, sentencing and other' law and order' responses.

131.Sharks. 鲨鱼  

Sharks killed four people and bit 58 others around the world in 2006, a comparatively dull year for dangerous encounters between the two species, scientists said in their annual shark attack census on Tuesday. Sharkbite numbers 【grew】 steadily over the last century as humans reproduced exponentially and 【spent】 more time at the seashore But the numbers have been 【stabilised】 over the past five years as overfishing 【thinned】 the shark population near shore and swimmers got smarter about the 【risks】 of 【wading】 into certain areas, Burgess said.

133.Sociology. 社会学  

Sociology is, in very basic terms, the study of human societies. In this respect, It is usually 【classed】 as one of the social sciences along with 【subjects】 like psychology and was 【established】 as a subject in the late 18th century through the work of people like the French writer Auguste Comte. However, the subject has only really gained 【acceptance】 as an academic subject in the 20th century through the work of writers such as Emile Durkheim, Max Weber and Talcott Parsons, names that will be visited throughout this course. One name that you may have heard of, Karl Marx, the founder of modem Communism, has probably done more to stimulate peoples interest in the subject than anyone else, even though he lived and wrote"1818- 1884" in a period before sociology became fully established as an academic discipline. Sociology, therefore, has a reasonably long history of development,"150- 200 years" 【although】 in Britain it has only been in the last 30- 40 years that sociology as an examined subject in the education system has achieved a level of importance equivalent to, or above, most of the other subjects it is possible to study.

134.Europa. 木卫二  

Scientists preparing for NASA's proposed Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter believe that Jupiter's moons Europa may be a corrosive mixture of acid and peroxide. Thus, it may not be the 【ideal】 place for life to exist as was thought possibly to be the case. 【Virtually】, all the information we have about Europa comes from the spacecraft Galileo, which completed its mission to study Jupiter and its moons close up before NASA dramatically crashed it into Jupiter in 2003. 【Although】 the general perception of Europa is of a frozen crust of water ice harbouring a salty subterranean ocean kilometres below, researchers studying the most 【recent】 measurements say light reflected from the moons icy surface bears the spectral fingerprints of hydrogen peroxide and strong acids. 【However】, they accept that it could just be a thin surface dusting and might not come from the ocean below.
