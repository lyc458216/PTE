**Comments: There is only a paragraph, but not include title.

1.Houston. 休斯顿

Houston is the fifth-largest metropolitan area in the United States and has an outsized 【impact】 on the U. S. economy. More than 90 percent of U. S. offshore oil and gas 【production】 takes place in the Texas Gulf Coast area, and the Houston region contains the largest 【concentration】 of energy, petrochemical, and refining industries in the United States. Houston is home to 25 percent of the country's petroleum refining capability, 40 percent of the nation's capacity for downstream chemical production, and the fastest-growing liquefied natural gas industry in the nation.

1.Monitoring Animals. 监测动物  

Monitoring animals is hard work. Field biologists have to follow 【tracks】 made by the animals and 【look】 out for fruit that they might like in order to find the animals, whether it be walking through rivers, up and down slippery hillsides with 【dense】 vegetation or through thick mud and swamps.

2.Law and Order. 法律和秩序  

The narrative of law and order is located fundamentally at the level of individual guilt and responsibility. Criminal acts are seen as individual issues of personal responsibility and 【culpability】, to which the state responds by way of policing, 【prosecution】, adjudication and punishment. This is but one level at which crime and criminal justice can be analysed. The problem is that so often analysis ends there, at the level of individual action, 【characterised】 in terms of responsibility, guilt, evil. In few other areas of social life does individualism have this hold. To take but one 【instance】, it would be absurd to restrict analysis of obesity to individual greed. It should similarly be widely seen as absurd to restrict analysis of criminal justice issues to the culpability of individuals.

3.Wrist Watch. 腕表  

The wrist watch works by 【tracking】 information such as a person's pulse or movement. When it 【detects】 a change in a person's health, the watch sends information to a touchscreen hub 【located】 in the home. The hub then 【alerts】 pre-determined contacts and calls for help immediately.

4.Blue sky. 蓝天  

The theme of contrast evident in Blue Skies is typical of Ms Vu's work. She explores organic structures using the newest technologies. She is inspired by 【minute】 detail but often works on a large scale. Her sculptures are 【ambiguous】, yet familiar, blurring the boundaries between the real and the artificial. Organic structures and spirals are the starting point for my creative exploration. Butmy work extends these concepts to explore the 【overlap】 between the real and the artificial, and how we often don't differentiate between the two,' Ms Vu said.

5.Brands. 品牌  

A brand consists of all the features that 【distinguish】 the goods and services of one seller from another: name, term, design, style, symbols, customer touch points, etc. Together, all 【elements】 of the brand work as a psychological trigger or 【stimulus】 that causes an association to all other thoughts one has had about this brand.

6.Tidal Energy. 潮汐能  

The Australian Maritime College at the University of Tasmania, in 【partnership】 with CSIRO and University of Queensland, have been awarded 2. 49 million in 【support】 for their new project that is set to attract and underpin investment in tidal energy in Australia. The project hopes to overcome barriers to investment in commercial- scale tidal farms in Australia by mapping the country's tidal energy in more 【detail】 than ever before.

7.Mercury. 水星/汞  

Mercury is not found in many common products that we buy because it can be very dangerous. The most common products that 【contain】 mercury are batteries, powerful outdoor lights, disinfectants and thermometers, which are used to measure our body's temperature. It can also be found in barometers, which are used to measure air pressure and 【show】 changes in weather, and thermostats, which 【regulate】 the temperature of buildings, Mercury can also be found in printer and photocopy toners.

8.The Hancock Building Artwork. 汉考克大厦艺术品  

Hancock Building, certainly 【lives】 up to its name. The 【title】 is derived from the Latin word "lucere", meaning "to shine", and the artwork's 3, 115 lights 【depict】 a scale map of the stars that shine in the night sky. The 13- foot art work 【contains】 thousands of glass bulbs, all fed light through blue illuminating fibre- optic lines. The sculpture, created by English artist Wolfgang Buttress with the help of astrophysicist Dr. Daniel Bayliss, represents a 3 D map of all the stars in the Northern Hemisphere that are able visible with the naked eye.

9.Maya. 玛雅文明/玛雅人  

The Classic Era of Mayan 【civilization】 came to an end around 900 AD. Why this happened is unclear; the cities were probably over- farming the land, so that a 【period】 of drought led to famine. Recent geological 【research】 supports this, as there appears to have been a 200- year drought around this time.

10.Philosophy. 哲学  

The philosophy of mind is a certain area of 【problems】 commonly recognised by English- speaking philosophers. But it is not an accident that this 【expression】 is hard to translate into other languages. This is only partly due to the fact that the English word"mind" has no exact 【equivalent】 in the other main European languages. It is also a reflection of the fact that the classification in which this label figures is itself based on certain profound philosophical assumptions, often unexpressed.

11.Talking. 交谈  

Talking is not just an activity of the vocal 【cords】, it is a way of connecting with ourselves and 【others】 that creates a culture of health and 【well-being】. Specifically, speaking with healthcare 【practitioners】 about health worries, and more generally opening up to create more and stronger social 【ties】, can have many positive benefits.

12.Tree and City. 树木与城市  

A new report by environmental 【nonprofit】 The Nature Conservancy lays out how trees could pave the way to cleaner air and cooler cities. Using 【geospatial】 information on forest cover paired with air pollution data and population 【forecasts】 for 245 cities, researchers found that trees have the biggest health 【payoffs】 in densely populated, polluted cities like Delhi, Karachi and Dhaka. The Conservancy and the C 40 Cities Climate Leadership Group presented the findings of their global survey this week at the American Public Health Association meeting in Denver, Colorado.

13.City Design. 城市设计  

The way we design our cities needs a serious rethink. After thousands of years of progress in urban development, we 【plateaued】 some 60 years ago. Cities are not safer, healthier, more efficient, or more 【equitable】. They are getting worse on these measures. The statistics on chronic disease, rising road tolls and congestion in our urban environments paint a 【bleak】 future. The clues to why lie in how we think about and design our cities.

14.An Artist's Life. 艺术家的生活  

The 【closing】 decades of an artist' s life do not generally make the biographer' s heart beat faster, but Claude Monet is one of a handful of painters who bucks the pattern of an 【irrelevant】 old age. While it' s true that by the time he was 73 he had 【accumulated】 all the usual dragging baggage- outhouses full of fancy cars, a taste for expensive wine and a sprawl of dependents- it was also now that he produced career- defining work.

15.Chapters. 章节  

Most chapters have a mixed exercise after the 【main】 work of the chapter has been completed. This will help you 【revise】 what you have done, either when you have finished the chapter or at a later date. All chapters 【end】 with some mathematical puzzles and practical investigational work. For this work you are encouraged to 【share】 your ideas with others.

16.Tomato. 番茄  

The tomato is probably the most widely grown 【vegetable】 by the home gardener because of its 【food】 value, many uses, and relative ease of 【culture】. Originating in Central and South America, the tomato was domesticated in Mexico. There are many related wild species in South America."Tomati" was the name 【used】 by Native Americans.

17.Deforestation. 森林砍伐  

Deforestation can disrupt the lives of local communities, sometimes with devastating 【consequences】. Forests provide a vast array of 【resources】 to all of us, including food, wood, medicine, fresh water, and the air we breathe. Without the trees, species can disappear, the natural water balance can become disrupted and the ecosystem that supports the human population can fall 【apart】.

18.Migration. 迁徙/移民  

Migration could be described as the well- defined journey animals make to a familiar 【destination】 at specific seasons or times of the year. All species that migrate do so for a common 【purpose】, in order to survive. Migration allows them to spend their life in more than one area and thus 【avoid】 problems that can occur in one habitat, such as lack of food, shelter or exposure to harsh weather.

19.Sleep issue. 睡眠问题  

Sleep 【deprivation】 is a global issue in all the major cities around the world where the amount of sleep is 【decreasing】 over decades. Now, the decrease is growing with the 【onslaught】 of the COVID-19 pandemic. Stress plays a major role in how we sleep. People are 【meant】 to have some kind of routines, and many people lost them during the pandemic and especially during lockdowns. People woke up and went to sleep at 【odd】 times, they ate at odd times, and all of that definitely affected their biological rhythms.

20.Alpine Newt. 高山蝾螈  

The Alpine Newt is native to much of central, continental Europe and 【occurs】 up the coasts of northeast France through to Holland. But it does not 【appear】 to have been native to the British Isles. As its name 【suggests】 it can be found in montane habitats up to 2, 500 metres in altitude but it can also be abundant in lowlands, and it will use a 【variety】 of waterbodies including both shallow and deep ponds and slow flowing streams.

21.Gender Equality. 性别平等  

With the popularity of the gender equality campaign and the cultural change, the 【traditional】 roles of men as the 【earner】, and of women in which they stay at home, are 【challenged】 today.

22.Bioenergy. 生物能源  

A Graphic Introduction was put together by northern artists, who have 【interpreted】 discussions with scientists from the Supergen Bioenergy Hub in a 【series】 of striking images which imagine alternative futures and explain some of the technology 【involved】 and how it might be put into practise.

23.Quake-resistant Structures. 抗震结构  

In the past, making structures quake- resistant meant firm yet 【flexible】 materials, such as steel and wood, that bend without breaking. Later, people tried to lift a building off its foundation, and insert rubber and steel between the building and its foundation to 【reduce】 the impact of ground vibrations. The most 【recent】 designs give buildings brains as well as concrete and steel supports, called smart buildings, the structures respond like living organisms to an earthquake's vibrations. When ground shakes and the building tips forward, the computer would 【force】 the building to shift in the opposite direction. The new designs should offer even greater 【security】 to cities where earthquakes often take place.

24.Car Mechanic. 汽车修理工  

A spokesman for the project said:"A car mechanic for 【instance】 could find at a glance where a part on a certain car model is so that it can be identified and repaired. For the motorist the system could 【highlight】 accident black spots or dangers on the road." In other cases the glasses could be worn by people going on a guided tour, 【indicating】 points of interest or by people looking at panoramas where all the sites could be identified.

25.Education. 教育  

Education is generally considered to be a key factor in improving outcomes for Indigenous Australians, with many studies showing that improved 【health】 and socioeconomic status are directly 【linked】 to educational participation and achievement. There is a range of issues 【affecting】 participation in education for Indigenous Australians, including 【access】 to educational institutions, financial constraints, and community 【expectations】.

26.Spending time. 消磨时间  

It is no secret that spending time in nature is good for your mind. Studies show that even a 【stroll】 through a city park decreases 【stress】, 【sharpens】 concentration and improves long-term mental health 【outcomes】. One report found that just being near bird song improved mental well-being.

27.Study of Leadership. 领导力研究  

Based on collaborative research by Arizona's top business schools, this study of leadership and company performance uncovers the effects of leadership driven by 【profits】, cost control, and maintaining market share, versus 【leadership】 driven more by balancing employee relations and development, customer or client 【needs】, and the welfare of the greater community. Together, Mary Sully de Luque, assistant professor of Management and Research Fellow at Thunderbird School of Global Management and David Waldman, director of the Centre for Responsible Leadership at ASU's School of Global Management and Leadership, have found that maintaining a specific focus on earnings in 【decision】 making can have negative effects on how a leader is viewed.

28.Airborne diseases. 空气传播疾病  

Airborne diseases are very easily transmitted and can result in respiratory illness that can be life threatening. It's therefore no wonder that 【outbreaks】 of airborne infectious diseases are a major public health 【concern】, and that researchers are working hard to come up with technologies to provide clean air. So far, however, such technologies have had limited 【success】.

29.Higher Education Shift. 高等教育转变  

After centuries of inequality in UK higher education benefiting men, there has been a 【reversal】 over the past three decades. A lower proportion of entrants to UK higher education institutions are male than ever before and they 【make】 up less than one- half of the total. Other developed countries have 【undergone】 a similar shift. Male 【underachievement】 is not seen only in the figures for entry but also in drop- out rates and degree performance statistics.

30.Keith Haring. 凯斯·哈林（艺术家）  

Keith Haring began as an underground artist, literally. His first famous projects were pieces of 【stylized】 graffiti drawn in New York subway stations. Haring travelled from station to station, drawing with chalk and chatting with commuters about his work. These doodles helped him develop his classic style and he 【grew】 so prolific, doing up to 40 drawings a day, that it was not long before fame and a measure of fortune followed. Soon, galleries and collectors from the art establishment wanted to buy full-sized pieces by Haring. The paintings 【skyrocketed】 in price but this did not sit well with Haring's philosophy. He believed that art, or at least his art, was for everyone. Soon, Haring opened a store which he called the Pop Shop, which he hoped would attract a broad range of people. While somewhat controversial among street artists, some of whom 【accused】 Haring of' selling out', the Pop Shop changed the way people thought about the relationship between art and business.

31.Honeybees. 蜜蜂  

It sounds like something out of a science fiction movie- or nightmare: millions of honeybees 【suddenly】 dying off, their bodies never found. Scientists have 【named】 the phenomenon' Colony Collapse Disorder', but they aren't 【united】 on the reason. Theories abound as to the 【cause】 of the mass die-off, ranging from the unlikely- cellphones affecting bees' navigational abilities- to the more 【plausible】 though still debated, widespread pesticide use.

32.Sound speed. 声速  

The speed of sound, otherwise known as Mach 1, varies with temperature. At sea level on a' standard day', the temperature is 59 Fahrenheit, and Mach 1 is approximately 761 mph. As the altitude increases, the temperature and speed of sound 【both】 decrease until about 36,000- 60,000 foot range, Mach 1 is about 661 mph. Because of the 【variation】, it is possible for an aeroplane flying supersonic at high altitudes to be slower than a subsonic flight at sea level. The transonic band, the' sound barrier' extends 【from】 around Mach 0.8- when the first supersonic shock waves form on the wing- to Mach 1.2, when the entire wing has gone supersonic.

33.Program. 程序/项目  

Our programme will develop your 【theoretical】 knowledge of Computer Science and your problem-solving and 【analytical】 skills, while enabling you to achieve the 【ultimate】 qualification for the IT professional. The programme structure is extremely 【flexible】, enabling you to personalise your MSc through a wide range of electives.

34.Sheepdog. 牧羊犬  

Considered highly intelligent, 【extremely】 energetic, acrobatic and athletic, they frequently 【compete】 with great success in sheepdog trials and dog sports. They are often 【cited】 as the most intelligent of all domestic dogs. Border Collies continue to be employed in their traditional work of 【herding】 livestock throughout the world.

35.Dictionary. 词典  

Samuel Johnson's Dictionary of the English Language is one of the most famous dictionaries in history. First published in 1755, the dictionary took just over eight years to compile, 【required】 six helpers and listed 40, 000 words. Each word was defined in detail, the definitions illustrated with quotations 【covering】 every branch of learning. It was a huge scholarly 【achievement】, a more extensive and complex dictionary than any of its predecessors- the comparable French Dictionnaire had taken 55 years to compile and required the dedication of 40 scholars.

36.Exoplanets. 系外行星  

Giant exoplanets, like the so-called' hot Jupiters' that are similar in 【characteristics】 to the solar system's biggest 【planet】 and orbit very close to their host stars, are excellent targets for 【astronomers】 in their search for their extrasolar worlds. The size and proximity of these planets are easy to 【detect】 as they create a large decrease in brightness when passing in front of their parent stars.

37.Studying law. 法律学习  

It is important to 【emphasise】 the need for hard work as an essential part of studying law, because far too many students are tempted to think that they can succeed by relying on what they imagine to be their natural ability, without bothering to add the 【expenditure】 of effort. To take an analogy some people prefer the more or less instant 【gratification】 which comes from watching television adaptation of a classic novel to the rather more 【laborious】 process of reading the novel itself. Those who 【prefer】 watching television to reading the book are less likely to study law successfully, unless they rapidly acquire a 【taste】 for text-based materials.

38.World Shakespeare Congress. 世界莎士比亚大会  

Over 800 Shakespeare scholars from almost fifty countries will gather at King's College London next week as the university co-hosts the 10 th World Shakespeare Congress to explore and honour the Bard's life and work. Organised by the International Shakespeare Association, ISA, the World Congress 【is】 held every five years and 2016 is the first time it will be co-hosted 【in】 two locations that were integral to both the personal and working life of William Shakespeare. Delegates will arrive in London on Thursday following the start of the Congress on Sunday in Stratford-upon-Avon. 【With】 a main theme of' Creating and Recreating Shakespeare', the Congress will look 【at】 the continuing global relevance of Shakespeare's work through a varied programme of plenaries, panels, seminars and workshops.

39.Private school. 私立学校  

Private schools in the UK are redoubling their marketing efforts to foreigners. Almost a third of the 68,000 boarding pupils at such schools 【already】 come from overseas. But now, with many UK residents 【unwilling】 or unable to afford the fees and a cultural 【shift】 away from boarding, many schools are looking abroad to survive. Overseas students now 【account】 for about 500 m pounds of fee income a year for boarding schools in the UK.

40.Research. 研究  

Research is a process of investigation leading to new 【insights】 effectively shared and is central to the 【purpose】 of any university. Students have the right to be taught by acknowledged 【experts】 in their field, which requires that staff members operate at the most advanced level appropriate to their 【discipline】 and level. Research is, therefore, crucial to a 【positive】 student experience from further education to doctoral development.

41.Botswana. 博茨瓦纳  

Although Botswana is rich in diamonds, it has high unemployment and stratified socioeconomic classes. In 1999, the nation 【suffered】 its first budget deficit in 16 years 【because】 of a slump in the international diamond market. Yet Botswana 【remains】 one of the wealthiest and most stable countries on the African 【continent】.

42.Shrimp farm. 虾养殖场  

【Over】 the past two decades around a third of the world's mangrove swamps have been 【converted】 for human use, with many turned into valuable shrimp farms. In 2007 an economic study of such shrimp farms in Thailand showed that the commercial profits per hectare were 9,632 dollars. If that were the only 【factor】, conversion would seem an excellent idea. However, proper 【accounting】 shows that for each hectare government subsidies formed 8,412 dollars of this figure and there were costs, too: 1,000 dollars for pollution and 12,392 dollars for losses to ecosystem services. These comprised damage to the supply of foods and medicines that people had taken from the forest, the loss of habitats for fish, and less buffering against storms. And because a given shrimp farm only stays 【productive】 for three or four years, there was the additional cost of restoring them afterwards.

43.Dances. 舞蹈  

Dance has played an important role in many musicals. In some 【cases】, dance numbers are included as an excuse to add to the colour and spectacle of the show, but dance is more effective when it forms an integral part of the 【plot】. An early example is Richard Rodgers On Your Toes, 1936, in which the story about classical ballet meeting the world of jazz enabled dance to be introduced in a way that 【enhances】, rather than interrupts the drama.

44.Conflicts. 冲突  

Most of us are 【scared】 of open conflict and avoid it if we can. And there is a 【risk】 to expressing and working through conflict. If the working involves harsh words and name-calling, people feel deeply hurt and relationships can be 【damaged】. Some group members may be afraid that if they really 【express】 their anger, they may go out of control and become violent, or they may do this. These fears can be very 【real】 and based on experience.

45.Genetically modified corn. 转基因玉米  

Almost no one regards corn with suspicion. But the 【same】 can't be said for humans' ingenious ability to engineer the plants we eat. Genetically modified, GM, crops are viewed with 【such】 hostility that they are barely grown in Europe. However, a new study by an independent group of scientists, who have done the most comprehensive 【review】 of the evidence so far, shows that our aversion to GM food is pointless, 【unscientific】 and harmful to farmers.

46.Next task. 下一项任务  

Having tracked down research that is 【relevant】 to your area of interest, the next task is to actually make 【sense】 of that research. This section is intended to show you how to be critical of the research you are 【reviewing】 and how to check that the 【evidence】 is credible and represented appropriately. Unfortunately, this means discussing the ways in which research findings may be misrepresented.

47.Britain's past. 英国历史  

The transitions which occurred in Britain around 100 BC, and after 43 AD, when the Roman Army 【invaded】 Britain, represent the key points of socio-economic trend in Britain's past. During the first century BC, the traditional communal form of life 【shifted】 rapidly to a world where certain individuals become more important. During the first century AD, Britain 【became】 fully a part of the Roman Empire.

48.Power station. 发电站  

The ruins of the South Fremantle Power Station have stood empty since 1985, home only to urban explorers and street 【artists】. Opened in 1951, the power station was once a pillar of progress for the expanding energy 【demands】 of Perth. Here is stood proud and strong for 34 years, supplying energy to its surrounding metropolis until 1985 when it was deemed to no longer be worth the 【money】. The doors were shuttered, and the plant's four tall chimney stacks were demolished, leaving the rest of the plant to rot by the sea.

49.John Milton. 约翰·弥尔顿（诗人）  

John Milton wrote in a wide range of genres, in 【several】 languages, and on an extraordinary range of subjects. His was a more general 【education】 than is offered at Cambridge these days, and it continued after his seven years here, equipping him with the tools to write some of the most 【groundbreaking】 literature ever seen, and to engage as a polemicist on many different social, political, and theological 【questions】.

50.Fossil fuels. 化石燃料  

But look beyond fossil fuels for the most intriguing trends. One is that the energy intensity of the world economy, the amount of energy it takes to produce one dollar's worth of 【income】, keeps falling, at a rate of about 2 percent. What this means is that even without any change in the 【relative】 shares of fossil-based and fossil-free sources in the world's energy mix, we could have 2 percent annual economic growth without increasing carbon emissions from energy use. Of course that is not enough to 【address】 climate change and we need more economic growth than that. It is 【nonetheless】 a stunning number, which refutes the claim by some environmentalists that permanent economic growth is fundamentally incompatible 【with】 finite physical resources.

51.Active learning classrooms. 主动学习教室  

Active learning classrooms, ALCs, are student-centered, technology-rich classrooms. They are easily identified with their large 【circular】 tables and movable seating designed to improve student 【engagement】 in class. Typically, each table is accompanied by a whiteboard and flat-screen monitor to display student work and larger rooms frequently have miniature bulb and microphones and at each table. In this way, students are able to 【signal】 if they have questions or want to speak to the 【entire】 room. ALCs provide the hands-on environment that has transformed old class from passive 【lecture】 to very active group design work.
