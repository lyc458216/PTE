1.Laurence Stephen Lowry. 劳伦斯·斯蒂芬·劳瑞

Lowry is famous for painting scenes of life in the 【industrial】 districts of North West England in the mid-20th century. He developed a 【distinctive】 style of painting and is best known for his urban landscapes peopled with human figures often referred to as 【matchstick】 man. He painted mysterious unpopulated landscapes, brooding 【portraits】 and the unpublished"marionette" works, which were only found after his death.

2.William Shakespeare. 威廉·莎士比亚

For all his fame and celebration, William Shakespeare remains a 【mysterious】 figure with regards to personal history. There are just two primary 【sources】 for information on the Bard: his works, and various legal and 【church】 documents that have survived from Elizabethan times. Naturally, there are many 【gaps】 in this body of information, which tells us little about Shakespeare the man.

3.CEO. 首席执行官

That brings us to the CEO's second duty: building 【everyone】 or more accurately, building the senior team. All the executives report to the CEO, so it's the CEO's job to 【hire】, fire, and manage the executive team. From 【coaching】 CEOs, I actually think this is the most important skill of all. Because when a CEO hires an excellent senior team, that team can keep the company running. when a CEO hire a poor senior team, the CEO is up 【spending】 all of their time trying to do with the team, and not nearly enough time trying to do with other elements of their job. The senior team can and often does 【develop】 the strategy for the company, but ultimately it's always the CEO who has the final"go- no- go" decision on strategy.

6.Getting bored in class. 上课走神

A majority of U. S. high school students say they get 【bored】 in class every day, and more than one out of 【five】 has considered dropping out, according to a survey released on Wednesday. The survey of 81, 000 students in 【twenty-six】 states found two-thirds of high school students complain of boredom, usually because the subject matter was 【irrelevant】 or their teachers didn't seem to care about them.

7.Bar code scanners. 条形码扫描器

Many different types of bar code scanning machines exist, but they all work on the same fundamental principles. They all use the 【intensity】 of light reflected from a series of black and white stripes to tell a computer what code it is 【seeing】. White stripes reflect light very well, while black stripes reflect hardly any light at all. The bar code scanner shines light 【sequentially】 across a bar code, simultaneously detecting and recording the pattern of reflected and non-reflected light. The scanner then 【translates】 this pattern into an electrical signal that the computer can understand. All scanners must include computer software to interpret the bar code once it's been entered. This simple principle has transformed the way we are able to 【manipulate】 data and the way in which many businesses handle recordkeeping.

8.H1N1. 甲型H1N1流感

9.Integrated ticketing. 综合票务系统

Well in 2004 we integrated ticketing in South East Queensland, so we have 【introduced】 a paper ticket that allowed you to travel across all the three 【modes】 in South East Queensland, so bus, train and 【ferry】, and the second stage of integrated ticketing is the introduction of a Smart Card, and the Smart Card will enable people to 【store】 value so to put value on the card, and then to use the card for 【traveling】 around the system.

10.Neo-Latin. 新拉丁语

Those of you who've never heard the term 【neo-Latin】, may be forgiven for thinking it's a new South American dance craze. If you're 【puzzled】 when I tell you it has something to do with the language of Romans, take heart, over the years many classes I know have 【confessed】 they are not really sure what it is either. Some have 【assumed】 that they are so-called' Late-Latin', written at the end of the Roman Empire. Others have supposed it must have something to do with the middle ages. Or perhaps it's that 【pseudo-Latin】 which my five and seven-year-old boys seem to have 【gleaned】 from the Harry Potter books, useful for spells and curses that they zip one another with makeshift paper ash ones. No, in fact, neo-Latin is more or less the same as the Latin that was written in the 【ancient】 world, classical Latin. So, what's so new about it?

11.Rammer. 夯土机

12.Traffic jam. 交通堵塞

For the first time, Japanese researchers have conducted a real-life experiment that shows how some traffic jams appear for no apparent reason. They placed the 22 vehicles on a 【single】 track, and asked the drivers to cruise around at a constant speed of 30 kilometers an hour. At first, traffic moves smoothly, but soon, the distance between cars started to 【vary】, and vehicles clumped together at one point on the track, but the jams 【spread】 backward around the track, like a shockwave at a rate of about 20 kilometers an hour. Real-life jams move backward at about the same speed.

13.Water crisis. 水危机

Now that story's been scotched, as only part of contingency planning. But it was a symptom of the dramatic turn of events in South Australia, and it flushed out other remarks from water 【academics】 and people like Tim Flannery, indicating that things were really much worse than had been 【foreshadowed】, even earlier this year. So is Adelaide, let alone some whole 【regions】 of South Australia, in serious bother? Considering that the vast majority of its drinking water comes from the 【beleaguered】 Murray, something many of us outside the State may not have quite realized. Is their 【predicament】 something we have to face up to as a nation?

14.Difference. 差异

The effect of the first difference is, on the one hand, to refine and 【enlarge】 the public views, by passing them through the 【medium】 of a chosen body of citizens, whose 【wisdom】 may best discern the true interest of their country, and whose 【patriotism】 and love of justice will be least likely to sacrifice it to temporary or 【partial】 considerations.

15.E-Library. 电子图书馆

16.Planting bananas. 香蕉种植

17.Chemical technology. 化学技术

The ocean has been getting bluer, according to a study published in the journal Nature. But that's not really good news for the PLANET. It means that the plants that give the ocean its GREEN tint aren't doing well. Scientists say that's because the ocean has been getting WARMER.

18.The ocean gets warm. 海洋变暖

The ocean has been getting bluer, according to a study published in the journal Nature. But that's not really good news for the 【planet】. It means that the plants that give the ocean its 【green】 tint aren't doing well. Scientists say that's because the ocean has been getting 【warmer】.

19.Contract patterns generator. 合同模板生成器

In animals, a movement is coordinated by a cluster of neurons in the spinal cord called the central contract patterns generator, CPG. This produces signals that drive muscles to 【contract】 rhythmically in a way that produces running or walking, depending on the 【pattern】 of pulses. A simple signal from the brain instructs the CPG to switch between 【modes】 such as going from a standstill to walking.

20.Beautiful buildings. 美丽建筑

Along the way, we have built 【unashamedly】 beautiful buildings, two of which have won and been runner- up in the prestigious United Nations World 【Habitat】 Award: the first time an Australian building has received that international honor. We rely on older 【concepts】 of Australian architecture that are heavily influenced by the bush. All residents have private 【verandas】 which allows them to 【socialize】 outdoors and also creates some"defensible space" between their bedrooms and public areas. We use a lot of 【natural】 or soft materials and build beautiful landscaped gardens.

21.Financial markets. 金融市场

Financial markets swung wildly yesterday in frenzied trading market by further selling of 【equities】 and 【fears】 about an unraveling of the global carry trade. At the same time trading in the European credit markets in London was exceptionally 【heavy】 as traders frantically reassessed their appetite for risk, prompting wild swings in the prices of the key derivatives. It was the third day of frenetic 【activity】 in the European credit markets, suggesting that equity market 【swings】 were prompting a wider repositioning of investors in a host of asset classes.

22.Oceanographer. 海洋学家

For many years the favorite 【horror】 story about 【abrupt】 climate change was that a shift in ocean currents could 【radically】 cool Europe's climate. These currents, called the overturning 【circulation】 bring warm water and warm temperatures north from the equator to Europe. Susan Loosier, an 【oceanographer】 at Duke University, says scientists have long worried that this ocean circulation could be disrupted.

23.Nanotechnology. 纳米技术

What is nanotechnology? Well, a report that was put together by a 【combination】 of the Royal Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering that came out last summer, 【identified】 two topics. Nano-science is the study of 【phenomena】 and the manipulation of materials at atomic, molecular and 【macromolecular】 scales, where properties differ significantly from those as a larger scale. Nanotechnologies are the design characterization, production and application of 【structures】, devices and systems by controlling shape and size at the nanometer scale. So I'll talk a little bit more in a moment about what a nanometer is, but 【loosely】 speaking people think of nanotechnologies as being a sort of a hundred nanometers or less.

24.Virus. 病毒

So a virus is something that you can't see by normal light microscopy, you need very advanced 【techniques】 for electron microscopy to see it, but that virus is not able to reproduce itself without a host and us as human beings are made up of lots of different cell 【types】 and we are interested in understanding at the molecular level how that virus infects the liver and why does it infect the liver and it doesn't infect the heart or it doesn't infect other 【tissues】.

25.Sea levels. 海平面

If sea levels continue to rise, eventually the property becomes 【inundated】 and the real value of the property, the vast bulk of its value will be in the value of the land, which of course is then unusable. And that's of course not 【ensured】 by proper insurance. Landowners and banks and other financial institutions that have lent money against the value of those 【properties】 are going to find that they suffer very serious losses and it's not at all obvious at the moment who would 【compensate】 them.

26.Tax increases. 税收增加

Working together, they figured out that if the government was going to propose some kinds of significant tax increases, which is a good 【strategy】, require me to at least lie something like 【getting】 something for those big tax brackets, not seeing any results. So the result of that was in the 【package】 of legislation that included the tax increases. There was awesome information to have significant 【expansion】 of coverage families where they can buy into their private 【insurance】.

27.Carbon-rich soil. 富碳土壤

Rebuilding carbon- rich agriculture soils is the only real productive, 【permanent】 solution to taking excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. She's 【frustrated】 that scientists and politicians don't see the same opportunities she sees. This year, Australia will 【emit】 just over 600 million tons of carbon. We can sequester 685 million tons of carbon by 【increasing】 soil carbon by half a percent on only 2 percent of the farms. If we increased it on all of the farms, we could sequester the 【whole】 world's emissions of carbon.

28.Housing market. 住房市场

Well, Alex, the National Association of Realtors is at least putting the champagne on ice. The industry group says the 【slight】 rise in sales for previously owned homes shows the housing market is finally stabilizing, which is the first sign of a recovery. Now, that of course is an interpretation of the 【numbers】 Alex, and one that's coming from an organization known for being somewhat of a cheerleader for the housing market, since its members are made up of 【realtors】 who've been losing a lot of money in the slump. Now, for a more 【sober】 view, I talked to Wellesley housing economist Karl Case, and he says the slight uptick in sales hardly 【offsets】 the fact that numbers are down 20 percent from the year before.

29.Young people's choices. 年轻人的选择

I think its really important for young people not to feel 【restricted】 in their choices and also to be aware of the choices that are available to them and obviously the media has an 【incredibly】 important role to play in that. I think we 【tend】 to talk about science as this big kind of monolith but of course, actually, it's this beautiful multifaceted thing. You know, there's almost something for everybody there. And there are so many different 【aspects】 of it. You know, somebody that's going to be attracted to working in biology might be a very different person from somebody who's attracted to engineering. I suppose it's about knowing the breadth of 【opportunities】 that are out there and so anything that universities and broadcast media can do to make sure that those opportunities are visible.

30.The entrepreneurs. 企业家

Why do we need more entrepreneurs right now? The entrepreneurs who create and run our businesses, who play by the rules, are in fact 【critical】 to our success as a nation. We need them especially today. Business, not government, will end this 【recession】. Government must help by creating fair rules, sound monetary policy, and by protecting our fellow citizens in periods when they are 【jobless】. We have to make way for the new entrepreneurial firms that will push us to frontiers of 【innovation】.

31.Economists. 经济学家

An economist sees the world basically through a typical micro-economic 【toolkit】. That involves things like thinking at the margin, rationality, opportunity cost, trade-offs. Economists like any other 【discipline】, rules, and its own way of seeing the world. So basically economics, or economists in general tend to apply 【micro-economic】 【concepts】 like that to explain the way humans behave and to make 【predictions】 about the future.

32.Mixed and unmixed liquids. 混合与未混合液体

Finally, we take a look at how to mix and unmix 【liquids】 at the flick of a switch. Sandrine tells us more. Oil and water don't usually mix, but the new chemical sensitive to light has been added here to 【blend】 them together. When 【exposed】 to UV light, the chemical changes its structure and becomes soluble in water. This causes two layers to form with the oil floating on top of the water chemical combo. This method should be cheaper than the current 【alternative】 which involves using high energy centrifuges.

33.British Library. 大英图书馆

To begin with, you should be standing in the main 【floor】 of the British Library. British Library situated in the Euston road next to some pipe crustacean press, in the foyer to the left of the 【information】 desk. It was a large white staircase. Follow this up towards the gallery at the top of the 【stairs】, pause and look to your left for attention. This is Robert Cotton, born in 1570, and died in 1631. Cotton was a member of parliament but he's mainly known as a great antiquarian 【collector】 of manuscripts. It is the covenant we have a great depth and the survival of many English manuscripts.

34.Investors confidence. 投资者信心

Higher interest rates have knocked investors 【confidence】 in putting their money into property, evidence suggests. The 【insurance】 company standard life says that the rate rises since last summer have led more people to question the wisdom of property investment.

35.Environment problems. 环境问题

Environment problems caused by hard rock mining involve water pollution by metals themselves, chemicals used in processing, acid 【drainage】, and sediment. Metals and metal-like elements in the ore are toxic and prone to cause trouble by ending up in nearby streams and water tables as a result of mining operations.

36.Van Gogh's sunflowers. 梵高的向日葵

These two paintings, both called sunflowers are generally accepted as the finest of several 【depictions】 of the thick-stemmed, nodding blooms that Van Gogh made in 1889 during his time in Arles. The first is now in the collection of the National Gallery in London, and the second is in the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. Van Gogh referred to this work as a"【repetition】" of the London painting. But art historians and curators have long been 【curious】 to know how different this"repetition" is from the first. Should it be considered a copy, an independent artwork or something in between? An 【extensive】 research project conducted over the past three years by conservation experts at both the National Gallery and Van Gogh Museum has concluded that the second painting was"not intended as an exact copy of the 【original】 example," said Ella Hendriks, a professor of conservation and restoration at the University of Amsterdam, who was the lead researcher on the project.

37.Cars in America. 美国汽车

There are some 250 million cars in America, 250 million cars in the country with just over 300 million people. And most of those vehicles, of course, are gas 【powered】. This poses a huge challenge given the limited supplies of oil and the growing 【urgency】 of the global warming crisis. But there is good news, according to our guests today. And that is we have the know-how and the technology to build 【sleek】, fast automobiles that don't use gasoline. These vehicles of tomorrow are powered by 【hydrogen】, electricity, bio-fuels, and digital technology. And they already exist. So what's stopping us from putting them on the roads? Our guests today will help answer that.

38.Facial expression. 面部表情

Is that person really glad to see me? Or are they just 【being】 polite? Some people struggle to distinguish a 【fake】 grin from a truly happy smile. And computers have found this task even more difficult, that is, until researchers 【develop】 a program to detect when a smile is genuine. Visual computing researchers at the University of Bradford in the U. K. started with software for 【simulating】 a changing facial expression. This program can examine a video clip of a human head and identify specific 【details】 around the eyes, cheeks and mouth. Then the program tracks the details moving relative to each other as the face smiles. Next, the scientists had their program 【analyzing】 two sets of video clips. In one, subjects performed posed smiles.

39.Kimbell. 金贝尔（美术馆）

The first section of the book covers new modes of assessment. In Chapter 1, Kimbell, Goldsmith College, London responds to 【criticisms】 of design programs as formalistic and conventional, stating that a focus on risk-taking than hard work in design innovation is equally problematic. His research contains three parts that include preliminary exploration of design innovation qualities, investigation of resulting classroom practices, and development of the evidence-based assessment. The assessment he describes is presented in the form of a structured worksheet, which includes a collaborative 【element】 and digital photographs, in story format. Such a device encourages stimulating ideas but does not recognize students as design 【innovators】. The assessment sheet includes holistic impressions as well as details about"having, growing, and proving" ideas. 【Colloquial】 judgments are evident in terms such as"wow" and"yawn" and reward the quality and quantity of ideas with the term,"sparkiness," which fittingly is a pun as the model project was to design light bulb packaging. In addition, the assessment focuses on the process of optimizing or complexity control as well as proving ideas with thoughtful criticism and not just generation of novel ideas. The definitions for qualities such as"technical" and"esthetic" pertaining to users are too narrow and ill-defined. The author provides 【examples】 of the project, its features and structures, students' notes and judgments, and their sketches and photographs of finished light bulb packages, in the Appendix.

40.Social harm. 社会危害

Social harm originates out of a series of 【debates】 within criminology about the narrowness of the definition of crime, that essentially, focuses on individual acts of harm, things like inter-personal violence, theft, so on and so forth. So the idea of social harm 【originally】 was to expand that notion of harm to encompass the harms that organizations and nation-states cause. But battery the idea of social harm really now transcends criminology so there are a group of 【writers】 who think that and I would include myself there, that actually there's something to social harm that could be very useful in term of trying to understand the harms that 【occur】 within society, to produce an objective and well-rounded analyzes of harm.

41.Candace Galen. 坎迪斯·盖伦

Candace Galen is based at the University of Missouri, in Columbia. And, being a biologist, she thought, why not use this astronomical 【phenomenon】 to study a biological one? Specifically: as the skies 【darken】 would daytime pollinators, like bumblebees and honeybees, call it 【quits】?"What better activity during an eclipse than to go out with a recorder and record the bees?"" So Galen asked 400 citizen scientists, including young students, to place audio recorders in 16 flower patches along the path of totality, in Oregon, Idaho and Missouri. When they analyzed the audio, they found that during 【partial】 eclipse, bee buzzing continued. But when totality hit, the bees went silent and only the conversational buzz of human observers could be heard. Then, as the moon passed and the sun again lit up the sky, the bees 【regained】 their buzz.

42.Green chemistry. 绿色化学

Green chemistry is a concept designed to develop 【technologies】 which allow chemistry to be practiced with minimal damage to the environment, or in an environmentally 【compatible】 way, and it's meant to cover both chemical processes and chemical 【products】. The center was set up about seven or eight years ago. And the idea was to provide a hub of activities that covered 【fundamental】 research work, international collaboration, but also educational development on public 【understanding】 of the project as well, and also networking so we network out to well over 1000 people around the globe.

43.Weather change. 天气变化

What I'm trying to understand and what other 【colleagues】 of mine are trying to understand, is how we moved from that cold climate condition to the warm climate condition that we enjoy today. We know from ice core research that the 【transition】 from these cold 【conditions】 to warm conditions wasn't smooth, as you might predict from the slow increase in solar radiation. And we know this from ice cores, because if you drill down into ice, you find annual bands of ice, and you can see this in the iceberg. You can see those blue-white layers. Gases are 【trapped】 in the ice cores, so we can measure CO2 that's why we know CO2 was lower in the past and the chemistry of the ice also tells us about the 【temperature】 in the polar regions.

44.Corals. 珊瑚

The way I look back in the past is by using the fossilized remains of 【deep-water】 corals. You can see an image of one of these corals behind me. It was collected from close to 【Antarctica】, thousands of meters below the sea, so, very different than the kinds of corals you may have been 【lucky】 enough to see if you've had a tropical holiday. So I'm hoping that this talk will give you a four-dimensional view of the 【ocean】. Two dimensions, such as this beautiful two-dimensional image of the sea surface 【temperature】. This was taken using a satellite, so it's got 【tremendous】 spatial resolution. The overall features are 【extremely】 easy to understand. The equatorial regions are warm because there's more sunlight. The polar regions are cold because there's less sunlight. And that allows big 【ice-caps】 to build up on Antarctica and up in the Northern Hemisphere.

45.Phone users. 手机用户

You know, without getting into the details of 【exactly】 how that happened or who she got it out, let's just say it was a bad situation. And she panicked because, like for many of us, her phone is one of the most used and 【essential】 tools in her life. But, on the other hand, she had no idea how to fix it, because it's a completely 【mysterious】 black box. So, think about it: what would you do? What do you really understand about how your phone works? What are you willing to test or fix? For most people, the answer is, nothing. In fact, one survey found that almost 80 percent of smartphone users in this country have never even replaced their phone 【batteries】, and 25 percent didn't even know this is 【possible】.

46.Radio telescope. 射电望远镜

Perhaps you've seen pictures of the 【large】 array of, you know, those radio telescopes in New Mexico, scanning the skies for 【intelligent】 life in the movie contact life Well radiant astronomers have caused to 【celebrate】 the first phase of a giant new Radio Telescope Array went 【operational】 in Northern California, it's going to help astronomers study things like black holes and dark 【galaxies】. All the while scanning the stars for, who knows, radio 【signals】 coming from somewhere else in the universe. Maybe ET is phoning home.

47.Earth warming. 地球变暖

The earth is warming. Almost all the Arctic 【summer】 ice may have melted by the end of the century, claims the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change the IPCC. The upside. 【Access】 to an estimated quarter of the world's oil and gas resources and the 【opening】 of the fabled Northwest Passage. The downside. The Arctic wilderness is lost as 【neighboring】 countries, Denmark and Greenland, Russia, Canada, Norway, and the United States all race to 【share】 in the bounty.

48.Interesting sound. 有趣的声音

I would have guessed a Wild West performer was 【practicing】 with a bullwhip while also vacuuming. But no. That sound is apparently produced by the aurora borealis, the northern lights. Since 2000 researchers at Finland's Aalto University have been 【collecting】 audio, as part of what's called the Auroral Acoustics project. Folk tales have long held that the lights also produce odd sounds, but the claims were hard to prove. And some researchers thought that any noises produced by the 【energetic】 particles, that cause the light show would be far too high in the sky to be heard on the ground. But the latest results indicate that at least some sounds are produced very close to the ground. A setup of three ground-based 【microphones】 allowed researchers to estimate that the sounds occur perhaps just 70 meters up. The results were just presented at the International Congress on Sound and Vibration in Vilnius, Lithuania. More information about the sounds of the northern lights could lead to a more complete understanding of the 【phenomenon】. So if you see an aurora, keep your ears open.

49.Auditory sensitivity. 听觉敏感性

Have you ever wanted to turn down the volume at a deafening 【concert】 or noisy bar? Envy the whale: a new study finds that toothed whales can reduce their own auditory sensitivity when they expect a loud sound. The work is presented at this week's Acoustics 2012 meeting. Whales and dolphins rely on their responsive hearing to interpret returning echolocation 【clicks】. Previous research suggested that these marine mammals could dull their hearing before uttering outgoing echolocation clicks, which are very loud. Could they use the same coping mechanism for 【external】 noises? To find out, researchers trained a false killer whale that a loud noise would always follow a brief warning signal. Then, they attached suction cup sensors to the outside of the whale's head and played the 【signal】. The sensors 【measured】 brainwaves that indicated the whale did reduce its hearing sensitivity in expectation of a clamor. The researchers hope to test other species as well. Loud noises from ships can disturb whales. To accommodate 【marine】 life, perhaps vessels could emit signals before making a ruckus, warning whales to tune us out.

50.Online dating. 在线约会

Bruch and her colleague Mark Newman studied who swapped messages with whom on a popular online dating platform in the month of January 2014. They 【categorized】 users by desirability using PageRank, one of the algorithms behind search 【technology】. Essentially, if you receive a dozen messages from desirable users, you must be more desirable than someone who receives the same number of messages from average users. Then they asked: How far"out of their league" do online daters tend to go when pursuing a partner?"I think people are optimistic 【realists】." In other words, they found that both men and women tended to pursue mates just 25 percent more desirable than themselves."So they're being optimistic, but they're also taking into account their own relative position within this overall desirability 【hierarchy】." And the study did have a few more lessons for people on the market:"I think one of the take-home messages from this study is that women could probably afford to be more aspirational in their 【mate】 pursuit."

51.Pharmaceutical industry. 制药行业

It is about a hundred years since the great Canadian-born physician Sir William Osler, Regius Professor of Medicine in Oxford, 【complained】 about the increasing influence of the pharmaceutical industry on the medical 【profession】. He would be turning in his grave at the way the 【industry】 now dominates doctors' 【prescribing】 habits. It does this not only by direct and indirect pressure on the doctors themselves, but also by 【encouraging】 the public to ask for scripts.

52.Almonds. 杏仁

And one particular crop, almond in the US and now in Australia, is 【transforming】 the world of beekeeping and of bees. What has happened is that something serendipitous came along that people found out, that doctors found out that almonds are good for you, a 【confection】, but it's good for you. The Almond Board got a very aggressive promotion going on for almonds. They actually, I just heard recently, send out sales reps to 【cardiologists】 at hospitals to promote the heart benefits of almonds. In a very good promotion of almonds, and it's 【legitimate】 promotion because they are a healthy food.

53.Drop in share prices. 股价下跌

Well, the simple explanation might be that yesterday's 【sudden】 drop in share prices pretty much across the board has created what market analysts like to call a buying opportunity. It tends to bring out investors to pick through the ruins, looking for 【bargains】. Decision by investors that sellers got a little carried away with things so the buyers have 【lifted】 all the major indexes today. The Dow, the NASDAQ, the S&P 500 were all up around half a percent in early trading today, and that wasn't a big surprise. The sell-off continued somewhat 【overseas】. European markets remain fairly weak, along with many of the Asian markets. But you'll remember that all this started with a big 【plunge】 of around 9 percent on the stock market in Shanghai. Well, Chinese rebounded by around 4 percent.

54.Science professorship. 科学教授职位

Well, I'm absolutely delighted first of all to have been 【appointed】 to this professorship. The role is going to be about public engagement in science, it is about marketing science 【accessible】 to as wide an audience as possible, it's about making it easier for our 【academics】 here at the University of Birmingham to talk about their research to the general public and it's not just about a one-way flow of information, it very much is about dialog.

55.Researchers. 研究人员

My current research at the moment is really quite broad. I work at the interface between the Arts and Humanities, particularly 【archeology】, but trying to find questions which are difficult to answer unless you start integrating computing and 【visualization】. So really I work in this boundary between trying to understand cultural questions about the past, but those sorts of questions that you can't address unless you start reconstructing, start modeling and visualizing past 【landscape】 objects and movement of people.

56.Electric cars. 电动汽车

DOMONOSKE: Tesla showed that you could make a luxury 【electric】 car for a profit. That got the attention of other luxury carmakers, also, government 【regulations】 from California and other states that promote electric vehicles. Automakers used to respond to these 【mandates】. They'd build what's called a compliance car. Chelsa Sexton, an industry consultant and electric vehicle advocate, explains. CHELSEA SEXTON: It is expensive. It's now volume. It's hard to get. It's somehow engineered to be a little bit 【unattractive】 in some way, very low range.

57.Motivational Deficiency Disorder. 动机缺失症

You've heard about SARS, AIDS and bird flu. Now 【researchers】 from Australia claim we're about to be hit by a new epidemic: Motivational Deficiency Disorder. According to the British Medical Journal, one in 【five】 people are said to suffer from Motivational Deficiency Disorder, or Moded, and most don't even know they have it. 【Symptoms】 include being unable to get out of bed in the morning, being trapped on the couch.

58.Professional service. 专业服务

Another way in which the industry exerts pressure on doctors is by offering us a variety of 【professional】 services. In one of these services, widely advertised to GPs, a company representative shows the Practice Manager how to use a company disk to' trawl' through the practice database identifying 【patients】 with problems which might be treatable with the company's products. When that has been done, a company-sponsored nurse interviews the selected patients and draws up a management plan for the GP which, if approved by the doctor, attracts a Medicare item number. One of these companies proudly announces that over 65, 000 patients were 【assessed】 in this way in 2005. What, one may ask, is a pharmaceutical company doing assessing patients? It is surprising that no government or professional body has stepped in to prevent this commercially sponsored program.

59.Dams. 水坝

Dams are huge man-made structures that act as 【barriers】 on a river. Today, the main reason people build dams is to produce electricity. They are also built to 【restrict】 and control the flow of water in a river. Throughout history, dams have been used to prevent flooding and to 【irrigate】 farmland. Dams supply about a sixth of the world's electricity and they significantly reduce the risk of floods and 【droughts】. They also make water easier to access, especially in desertlike areas, where water is in low supply. There are, however, some negative effects of damming rivers. Many people's homes are knocked down to make space for the dam, and flooding can 【occur】 in the reservoir, which is the area behind the dam where water collects. This can cause valuable farmland to become submerged under the lakes.

60.Beekeeper. 养蜂人

Dave Hackenberg, a beekeeper since 1962, can usually tell what killed his bees just by looking at them. If they're lying on the 【ground】 in front of the hive, it's probably pesticides, he says. If the bees are 【deformed】 and wingless, it's probably 【vampire】 mites. But last fall, Hackenberg saw something he had never seen before. Thousands of his bee colonies simply 【disappeared】. He was in Florida at the time, pulling the lids off some of his commercial hives. To his 【horror】, they were all empty.

61.Well-being. 幸福感

Life in the UK 2012 provides a unique overview of well-being in the UK today. The report is the first snapshot of life in the UK to be delivered by the Measuring National Well-being program and will be updated and published annually. Well-being is discussed in terms of the economy, people and the environment. Information such as the 【unemployment】 rate or number of crimes against the person are presented alongside data on people's thoughts and feelings, for example, satisfaction with our jobs or leisure time and fear of crime. Together, a richer picture on' how society is doing' is provided.

62.Dogs and hygiene hypothesis. 狗与卫生假说

Dogs aren't just man's best friend. Previous studies have shown that kids with dogs are less likely to develop asthma. Now a new study may show how- if results from mice apply to us. The work was presented at a meeting of the American Society for Microbiology. The study tests what's called the 【hygiene】 hypothesis. The idea is that extreme cleanliness may actually promote disease later on. Researchers collected dust from homes that had a dog. They fed that house dust to mice. They then infected the mice with a 【common】 childhood infection called 【respiratory】 syncytial virus or RSV.

63.Adidas. 阿迪达斯

Adidas 【teamed】 up with an organization called Parley for the Oceans. Parley goes out and collects plastic waste from the ocean. Adidas uses plastic waste to make shoes. Shoes made with plastic from the ocean: good for the 【environment】 and good for business. Because if you know that rapidly growing consumer 【segment】 known as hipsters, and I know you know hipsters, then you know that a hipster faced with the 【choice】 between a no-name shoe and an Adidas made with plastic from the ocean will pick the Adidas every day of the week and twice on Sunday, and then walk around like it's no big deal but look for every 【opportunity】 to talk about them.

64.Medical care. 医疗护理

So two decades later, what's changed? It's now widely recognized that just 20 percent of health 【outcomes】 are tied to medical care, whereas up to 70 percent are tied to healthy behaviors and what's called the social 【determinants】 of health. Basically, everything that happens to us for that vast 【majority】 of time when we're not in the doctor's office or the hospital. Healthcare 【executives】 now routinely remind us that our zip code matters more than our genetic code. And one health care publication even recently had the 【audacity】 to describe the social determinants of health as"the feel-good buzzword of the year".

65.Technology and business. 技术与商业

Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. My theme for this 【session】 is convergence Technology Change and Business Practice. This is somewhat dear to my heart, in that I have spent much of the last fifteen years involved in various 【aspects】 of technology and their impact on business, across a broad 【spectrum】, from applications of signal processing in manufacture right through to the use of utilization data and diary applications, to improve the time utilization of the 【sales】 force.

66.Age. 年龄

What was interesting and revealing about younger and middle-aged views on old age was how 【relative】 these were to the individuals' own age. Those in their teens regarded 40 as old whereas those in their 40 s thought 70 or 80 was old. For many, health was seen as a 【determining】 factor in deciding who is old, and many young participants commented on how fit and active their grandparents are, while others thought ill-health and 【dependence】 were an inevitable part of aging. The majority of participants, however, regarded old age as something negative, and many expressed fear of 【growing】 old.

67.Lead-in time. 准备时间

Lead-in time is the amount of time that elapses between a business placing an order with a supplier for more stock or raw 【materials】 and the delivery of the goods to the business. Businesses want the lead-time to be as short as possible so that they can meet their customers' orders and 【minimize】 the time between paying for the stock and receiving the 【feedback】 from the customer. However, this may not happen due to a number of 【factors】, such as delays in the supplier receiving the order, or the breakdown of the suppliers' lorries 【delivering】 the stock to the business.

68.Early chocolate. 早期巧克力

The earlier chocolate was quite unpalatable. They used to add things to it to make it more palatable, so for the early chocolate, they didn't know how to extract all the 【cocoa】 fat from it. So it was, or could be quite 【greasy】 and if you made it as a drink, you'd have this sort of scum on the top. So they used to try and add things to it, like 【starch】 and things, to make it a more palatable product. So there were a lot of or 【scandals】 around the kind of things they were adding to chocolate in the nineteenth century. So by the sort of 1870 s, 1880 s, there are people like Cadbury's saying,' Our chocolate is absolutely pure'. We have this new process, the Van Houten process which now extracts all this 【horrible】 fat that we can use to make eating chocolate. Now we have a pure product.

69.Palm oil. 棕榈油

So, palm oil is the most widely produced oil crop currently. It's used in a wide range of 【industries】, including food for biofuels and in soaps and shampoo. However, though sector's growing fast, and unfortunately palm oil grows in exactly the same 【environment】 as tropical rainforests. So, the use and the 【development】 of palm oil, the growth in the sector, is leading to wide-scale deforestation. What we are hoping to do is if we can come up with an 【alternative】 we can slow the growth of the sector and therefore stop the wide-scale 【deforestation】 in south Asia.

70.Superiority. 优越性

As with all human behavior, there are 【numerous】 reasons for it. But often it's caused by someone who feels the need to show their 【superiority】 over someone else, in order to feel that they aren't at the lowest level in 【hierarchy】 or a group of people. In some cases, one person simply dislikes the other, on the 【basis】 that the personality of one is in some way 【incompatible】 with that of the other person.

71.Loose theme. 松散主题

We've decided to adopt, just as a loose theme for the course, a 【biological】 theme so that you can see the connections between chemistry and biology and the things you might consider doing in the future. We want you to think about the 【molecules】 that are relevant to your body, the processes that occur in your body, the chemistry that's going on and how 【energy】 plays a role. And we've divided the course into four sections and after each section, there will be a mid-term. The first one is about 【matter】.

72.Innovation policy. 创新政策

One seminal difference in policy remains; the 【coalition】 has not matched what is Labor's most important innovation promise. That is to bring together responsibilities for innovation, industry, science and research under one single federal minister. Innovation responsibilities 【currently】 lie within the powerful Department of Education and Science, and while there is a 【separate】 industry department, it has little influence within Cabinet. This has 【hampered】 policy development and given Australia's innovation policies a distinct science and research 【bias】. It is the scientists rather than the engineers who call the tune in innovation policy in Canberra, so it's no surprise our policies are all about boosting government-funded research and later 【commercializing】 their results.

73.Mars touchdown. 火星着陆

Touchdown confirmed. We are safe on Mars. The control room at NASA's Jet Propulsion 【Laboratory】 late in the evening of August 5th, Pacific time, when word arrived that the Curiosity rover had landed safely on Mars. The one- ton rover, which dwarfs all Mars landers that came before it, will now spend a planned two years 【exploring】 the Martian surface. The mission is expected to cost 2.5 billion dollars. Curiosity's task is to investigate the inside of Gale Crater, where a giant mound of 【sedimentary】 deposits may provide evidence of a wetter, possibly habitable Mars billions of years ago. But first it had to survive an elaborate landing 【sequence】 which appears to have gone smoothly. Curiosity landed on time and on target and soon beamed back grainy photos of its wheels and its shadow. Given the carlike size of the rover and the challenges of landing on Mars, Curiosity's 【landing】 goes down as one of the greatest parking jobs in history.

74.Cultural heritage. 文化遗产

All around the world, significant parts of our cultural heritage are 【threatened】 by pollution, neglect, 【carelessness】 and greed. In learning the importance of our history, we come to understand the need to protect significant 【remains】 from the past so that future 【generations】 can come to understand their heritage.

75.Cavemen. 穴居人

You might picture Neanderthals as cavemen gnawing on bones around a campfire. Which wouldn't be 【inaccurate】. But Neanderthals may have also dined on roasted vegetables and known a bit about medicinal plants too. So says a study in the journal Naturwissenschaften, The Science of Nature. Researchers 【analyzed】 hardened dental plaque from five Neanderthals found in El Sidron cave, in northern Spain. Yes, 50000-year-old dental plaque. And they found a lot lurking between the teeth. Like evidence of nuts, grasses and green veggies, 【chemical】 traces of wood smoke, and tiny, intact starch granules, proof Neanderthals ate their carbs. And in one individual, they detected compounds found in the 【medicinal】 herbs chamomile and yarrow. The herbs have no nutritional value, and since Neanderthals did have the gene to detect the herbs' bitter taste, the researchers 【speculate】 that the cave dwellers were munching on them not as food- but to self-medicate. Not too far-fetched, they say, because primates like chimps also use medicinal plants. Luckily for the scientists doing this 【detective】 work, Neanderthals may have known a thing or two about medicine, but they didn't get regular check-ups at the dentist.

76.Banana. 香蕉

One day the banana is perfect. Bright yellow, firm, flavorful. But even within that same day brown spots appear on your perfectly ripe banana, its flesh turns mushy, and it's destined for the compost or at best, banana bread. But scientists are developing a way to 【extend】 the life of ripe bananas. It's a spray-on coating made from chitosan- a substance found in crab and shrimp shells. The new gel can be 【sprayed】 on bananas to slow the ripening process by up to 12 days. Like other fruit, bananas remain alive after being picked and it actually continues to respire. This means that they take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide. The more the banana 【breathes】 the faster it ripens and then rots. Bananas ripen more quickly than most fruit because they don't naturally slow the 【respiration】 after being picked, in fact, it speeds up, causing bananas to become mushy. Chitosan not only kills the 【bacteria】 on banana's skin that then leads to rot, it also 【significantly】 slows down the respiration in the first place. So bananas won't drive you bananas.

77.Memory. 记忆

So in a very important sense, memory is the cognitive function that stores knowledge that we've acquired through learning and 【perception】, but also memory is important because memory frees our behavior from being 【controlled】 by the present stimulus environment. If you didn't have memory, all you'd be able to do was 【react】 to whatever is currently in the environment now, whatever it is that you're 【experiencing】. But memory allows us to respond to past events as well as events in the current stimulus environment. And memory also gives us the means to 【reflect】 on our experiences so that we plan for future encounters.

78.Locomotion of apes. 猿类运动方式

We are trying to understand the locomotion of one of our closest living 【relatives】, which is the orangutan, and also the locomotion of all of the apes and the common ancestor of humans and the other apes. And in that area, we have had a big problem 【traditionally】, and that we know a lot about how they move around the forest. I've been out to the forest and spent a year recording the 【different】 types of locomotion they use, but we have no idea about the 【energetic】 cost of how they move around the forest and the solutions that they find to problems of moving around the canopy. And what we're doing here is using the park or athletes as an analogy for a large-bodied ape moving around a complex 【environment】 and getting them to move around in the course that we've made that they've never seen before. And we're going to record their energetic expenditure while they're doing it.

79.Productivity. 生产力

I'm going to argue that the 【tremendous】 increases in productivity that we 【associate】 with the industrial revolution originate not so much from changes in science or 【technology】 or new inventions, where England was far from 【unique】 as from changes in attitudes, attitudes towards morality, towards what constituted the good. Attitudes towards property, which became in England individuals long before it did on the 【continent】. Attitudes toward the proper role of government and 【together】, these attitudes constitute much of what the Luddites were protesting against.

80.Malaria. 疟疾

Also, malaria is something that is a very complex disease with this complex life cycle. That means that if you're going to 【eliminate】 it, you have to be able to target cute parasites and humans. You have to be able to target parasites in the mosquitoes, that mosquito 【population】. And so that requires a lot of resources. It requires really good planning and a health system across all these different 【levels】. And so I think the political capital that you need for that, the educational 【infrastructure】 you need for that, the economic resources you need for that are quite a 【challenge】.

81.Corporate culture. 企业文化

For a long time now, it's been a widely accepted and 【rarely】 questioned belief that a strong corporate culture goes hand in hand with success. However, a recent study has 【cast】 some doubt on this principle. After all, the 【authors】 of the report argue for culture. A company builds up may be strong, but wrong. There is little point in every 【employee】 marching to the same tune if they are all marching in the wrong direction.

82.Library Catalog. 图书馆目录

In this tutorial, we will show you how to find specific journal articles using the library catalog. The university 【subscribes】 to over 18, 000 journals across a variety of subjects, most of which are available 【electronically】 to find a specific journal article using a library catalog. We need to 【search】 by the journal name as individual article titles are not 【listed】 in the catalog.

83.Belief. 信仰

Belief is the human capacity to imagine, to be creative, to hope and dream, to 【infuse】 the world with meanings, and to cast our 【aspirations】 far and wide. Limited neither by personal experience nor material reality. Believing is a 【commitment】, an investment, a devotion to possibilities. Beliefs 【permeate】 neurobiologies, bodies and ecologies acting as dynamic agents in evolutionary processes. The human capacity for belief, the 【specifics】 of belief, and I, and our diverse belief systems shape, structure and alter our daily lives, our societies, and the world around us.

84.Life on Mars. 火星生命

The thing that makes it difficult is because even if life had evolved on Mars, the chances of being preserved are very small. If we use Earth as a 【reference】 and our planet is teeming with life, yet it rarely preserves evidence of life of the fossil record. And the focus now is on exploring for 【habitable】 environments. If you're looking for water, a 【source】 of energy, either solar energy or thermal energy or chemical energy, and then 【organic】 carbon, assuming life as we know it on Earth based on carbon. So those are sort of the three things that we're looking for in the course of our mission.

85.Sceptical Environmentalist. 怀疑环保主义者

Some years ago, Bjorn Lomborg, a young Danish statistician, published a book called The Skeptical Environmentalist. It became a 【bestseller】 and generated a lot of heat. Lomborg was attacked, abused and 【accused】 of all manner of things; not because he denied the fact of global warming- in fact he 【affirmed】 it- but because, on his analysis, the devil and, he says, a lot of 【deviousness】 was contained in the details presented concerning the size of the problem and what were the most 【responsible】 steps to take in response to global warming.

86.Marie Curie. 玛丽·居里

My hero is Marie Curie. She was a Polish physicist and chemist working in France, and she did 【conduct】 pioneering research on radioactivity. She was also the first woman who won a Nobel prize. Marie Curie is my hero because she showed a lot of 【determination】 in following her career path and her 【passions】. She also showed a lot of 【patience】 in working for years to receive results from her experiments. And Marie Curie, she designed and built the first 【mobile】 X- Ray machines. She worked on the front lines of the first World War along with her daughter saving soldiers.

87.Quantum Mechanics. 量子力学

So, what is quantum mechanics? Even though it was discovered by 【physicists】, it's not a physical theory in the same sense as electro 【magnetism】 or general relativity. In the usual"【hierarchy】 of sciences"-- with biology at the top, then chemistry, then physics, then maths-- quantum mechanics sits at a 【level】 between maths and physics that I don't know a good name for. Basically, quantum mechanics is the 【operating】 system that other physical theories run on as application software- with the 【exception】 of general relativity, which hasn't yet been successfully ported to this particular OS.

88.Feasting Food. 盛宴食物

One of the things that people have said about agriculture is that on the whole it's more labor 【intensive】 than hunting and gathering, and that's one of the reasons why people have looked to explanations which, you might say, are kind of 【coercive】 factors- that people have been forced into agriculture because they had no alternative. That is 【ultimately】 what may happen. But at the very beginning it could be that agriculture was developed because people wanted special status foods for feasting; that it was actually a 【social】 need. I mean, how much of what we do in our lives is generated by competition with others? And a lot of that is powered by desire for new things, new statuses, new 【whatever】 it might be. Respect, recognition also are important. And in small- scale societies a lot of those sorts of factors are 【generated】 by the ability to, for instance, throw feasts. One possibility is that some of these foods that were being grown were actually intended especially as feasting foods.

89.Viking. 维京人

For four centuries the Viking 【declined】, the people of the Shetland Islands off the north coast of Scotland continued to sell their goods through the North European Hanseatic League. The Hansas merchants bought shiploads of 【salted】 fish and in return the islanders got cash, grain, cloth and other goods. This lasted until the Act of Union between Scotland and England in 1707. This Act prohibited the Hansa merchants from 【trading】 with Scotland. Consequently Shetland went into an economic 【depression】. The independent farmers of Shetland had to sell their land and were then 【obligated】 to pay rent, eventually becoming serfs.

90.Growth of the Modern State. 现代国家的成长

The growth of the modern 【state】 brought with it the development of mass political parties and the emergence of professional politicians. A man whose occupation is the 【struggle】 for political power may go about it in two ways. First, a person who relies on their political activities to supply their main 【source】 of income is said to Live off politics, while a person who 【engages】 in full- time political activities, but who doesn't receive an income from it, is said to live for politics. Now, a political system in which 【recruitment】 to positions of power is filled by those who live for politics is necessarily drawn from a property- owning elite, who are not usually entrepreneurs. However, this is not to imply that such politicians will necessarily pursue policies which are wholly 【biased】 towards the interests of the class they 【originate】 from.

91.Cerberus. 刻耳柏洛斯（地狱三头犬）

I think that's not going to be such a 【viable】 option for Cerberus, but that may be the way that they're gonna approach it. Private 【equity】 of course is supposed to have the advantage of taking management out of the spotlight of quarterly profits and industry 【analysts】, and prying shareholder eyes, and that, 【hypothetically】, gives them a chance to take slower, more 【patient】 routes to doing something to turn a company around. I would hope, and I have some, I guess, 【optimism】 that some of the Cerberus team will have some creativity and imagination.

92.Interview. 面试

Obviously, this is all relevant to your final 【assignment】. So we're going to talk about it. So until today, we've gone through face to face interviews as the main sort of part of interviewing the window. Today we're going to have a look at going to use an email and why they work, why they don't necessarily work, and what are the 【challenges】 and some of the things that we need to be understanding, you know when we are completing such interpreters. So let's start with the foreign one. Obviously, there are a few 【benefits】 to them, and they are listed there up on that slide. It's obviously less stressful for those of you who might be a little bit 【anxious】 about interviewing.

93.Problem for Undergraduate Students. 本科生面临的问题

To be honest, the biggest problem for most undergraduate students, in terms of academic writing, is not only adapting to a far more 【structured】 and formal style, but also learning how to ascertain the difference between important, 【valid】 information and unnecessary, or even irrelevant 【material】. In my experience, I would say it takes students their first year, if not longer, to 【appreciate】 what is required and to start to implement those requirements in their writing. What they really should be doing, if they are struggling with written 【assignments】 is to seek help from the 【excellent】 support services which are available at the University.

94.Exploring Ocean Structures. 探索海洋结构

Scientists are studying the 【deep】 ocean to learn more about its hidden ecosystems. They use advanced technology to explore underwater environments. In 【certain】 shallow areas, the water's 【depth】 is easier to measure and study. These regions often reveal fascinating marine life. The 【strong】 infrastructure built on the ocean 【floor】 helps support research and conservation efforts. This work is crucial for protecting marine biodiversity.

95.Different Types of Work. 不同类型的工作

Some people prefer 【doing】 simple tasks at their job because they are easy to complete. These tasks often require less time and effort. Others enjoy more 【difficult】 complex challenges that test their problem-solving skills. These projects can take days or even weeks to finish. Both types of 【mental】 work are important in a workplace to keep things running smoothly. It depends on the person's skills and preferences.

96.Art Gallery Exhibition. 艺术画廊展览

At the art gallery, 【almost】 every painting on display captured the attention of visitors. The artist used bold techniques to create dramatic effects. One piece featured a 【large】 huge portrait of a person's 【face】 that filled the entire canvas. The lighting in the artwork created a striking 【dark】 shadow across the image. This made the painting look more realistic and emotional. Many people admired the creativity.

97.Javelin Competition at the Sports Festival. 体育节标枪比赛

The 【main】 biggest event at the sports festival was the javelin competition. Athletes from all over the country came to participate. Many 【young】 people were excited to show their skills in 【throwing】 the javelin as far as possible. They were organized into different 【school】 teams to compete against each other. The 【top】 biggest team, which had the most experienced members, took the lead. They 【quickly】 started the competition with an impressive throw.

98.Team Dynamics in Sports. 体育中的团队动态

A successful sports team often has a strong 【team】 culture that unites its players. This shared identity helps them work together effectively. The team's 【good】 cooperation during practices and games is key to their performance. Everyone supports each other to achieve their goals. It's 【widely】 expected that they will win the championship this year due to their hard work. Fans are excited to see the results.

99.Social Behavior in Children. 儿童社交行为

Some children are naturally more 【outgoing】 sociable and enjoy interacting with others from a young age. They often make friends easily in social settings. However, a few of them might be 【later】 diagnosed with social anxiety as they grow older. This condition can make it harder for them to connect with people. Early support can help them overcome these challenges. Parents and teachers play a big role in this process.

100.Puffin Behavior and Conservation. 海鹦行为与保护

The 【Atlantic】 puffin is a small seabird known for its colorful beak and unique behaviors. It lives in colonies on rocky cliffs near the ocean. This bird 【often】 allows other species to share its habitat without much conflict. However, it must be cautious of 【natural】 predators like seagulls that might steal its food. The puffins 【often】 cooperate with each other to protect their nests from danger. A 【global】 corporate organization recently started a campaign to keep these birds 【feeling】 safe by raising awareness. They introduced a new 【public】 conception of wildlife protection to the public. This led to increased 【public】 consumption of eco-friendly products to support the cause.

101.Driving License Test Preparation. 驾照考试准备

The driving school is always 【very】 busy during the summer as many students sign up for lessons. They want to get their licenses before school starts. The 【driving】 instructor is responsible for teaching them how to drive safely. They are 【currently】 requiring each student to demonstrate their 【driving】 ability to handle the car properly. This ensures everyone is ready for the road. Passing the test is a big achievement for new drivers.

102.Active Careers in Infrastructure. 基础设施领域的活跃职业

People who enjoy an 【energetic】 active lifestyle often choose jobs that keep them on the move. They prefer roles that involve physical activity over sitting at a desk. These 【physically】 interesting jobs, like working as a tour guide, allow them to explore new places. Many of these roles also support the 【infrastructure】 of a city, such as transportation or tourism. Choosing such a 【dynamic】 career can be rewarding for those who love adventure. It keeps them engaged and motivated.

103.New Science Teacher at School. 学校的新科学老师

Mr. 【James】 Lowery is the new science teacher at our school this year. He has a passion for teaching students about the environment. His classes are always full of exciting experiments. Everyone enjoys learning from him.

104.Innovations in Local Farming. 本地农业创新

Local farmers 【often】 frequently experiment with new methods to grow their crops more efficiently. They want to improve their harvests each season. Different 【types】 or styles of farming, such as organic or vertical farming, are becoming popular. Many 【local】 farms now offer subscription services to deliver their produce directly to customers. They pack 【fresh】 vegetables into a 【container】 box for families to enjoy weekly. This ensures people have access to healthy food.

105.Traditional Jobs in a Modern World. 现代世界的传统工作

Many people still prefer 【having】 traditional careers like teaching or farming because they are stable. These roles have been around for centuries and remain important. However, the 【real】 reality of today's job market is that technology is changing how work is done. Many of these 【traditional】 jobs now require digital skills to stay competitive. Young people often 【prepare】 apply for these roles while also learning new technologies. This combination helps them succeed in a modern world.

106.Growth of Technology Systems. 技术系统的增长

The tech industry continues to 【rapidly】 burgeon as new innovations emerge every year. This growth is transforming how we live and work. Advanced 【computer】 systems like artificial intelligence are now part of everyday life. They help automate tasks and improve efficiency. Their 【overall】 contribution to society is significant, making processes faster and more accurate. Many businesses rely on these technologies to stay competitive.

107.The Biology of Personalities. 人格生物学

Scientists have discovered that people's 【unique】 personalities can be influenced by their genetic makeup. This connection between traits and DNA is fascinating. From a 【genetic】 biology perspective, certain behaviors are linked to specific genes. These traits can often be 【observed】 visible in how individuals interact with others. For example, some people are naturally more outgoing than others. This research helps us understand human behavior better.

108.Selling Furniture Successfully. 成功销售家具

When selling furniture, the 【visual】 color of the items plays a big role in catching a buyer's eye. Bright or unique shades can make a piece stand out. The 【perceived】 value of the furniture also matters, as customers want quality for their money. A good price can make the deal more appealing. Finally, the design must 【effectively】 attract potential buyers by matching their style preferences. This combination helps increase sales.

109.Statins for Type 2 Diabetes. 他汀类药物治疗2型糖尿病

Most patients with Type 2 diabetes should start taking statins, the cholesterol- fighting drugs, as a 【preventative】 measure against heart disease, whether or not they have high cholesterol levels, according to new guidelines released yesterday. The recommendations, from the American College of Physicians, call for moderate doses of statins by people with diabetes who are older than 55, and for younger 【patients】 who have any other risk factor for heart disease, like high blood pressure or a history of 【smoking】. The new guidelines are outlined in April 20 issue of The Annals of Internal Medicine, in an article that noted that about 16 million Americans have Type 2 diabetes and that 800, 000 new cases are 【diagnosed】 every year. The lead author of an article accompanying the guidelines, Dr. Sandeep Vijan of the University of Michigan, said that"almost everyone with Type 2 diabetes should be on a statin." The 【average】 age at diagnosis is 48, and even many patients under 55 have high blood pressure as well as diabetes, he said. Traditionally, diabetes treatment has 【focused】 on regulating blood sugar levels by careful control of 【diet】 or through insulin injections. But researchers have come to understand that control sugar really protects only against the destruction of small blood 【vessels】, which can lead to blindness or loss of fingers, toes or limbs. Heart disease is, in fact, the more serious threat. Up to 80 percent of diabetes patients will develop heart problems or die of them, the article said. And Dr. Vijan emphasized that controlling hypertension remained the highest priority. He ranked control of lipids, the fats in the blood 【stream】 that can affect coronary health, second, ahead of glucose 【regulation】.

110.The Impact of Technology in Society. 技术对社会的影响

Technology has brought a significant 【benefit】 to society by improving communication and access to information. It allows people to connect instantly across the globe. For 【humans】, this means better collaboration and the ability to share knowledge more effectively. Many tools we use daily have become 【common】 in households, such as smartphones and computers. This widespread use creates an 【opportunity】 for everyone to learn new skills and participate in the digital world. Education and innovation continue to grow as a result.

111.Scientific Research in Biology. 生物学科学研究

A scientist who 【cares】 about the environment often focuses on how living organisms interact with their surroundings. They study these interactions to understand ecosystems better. In the field of 【biology】, researchers observe how plants and animals 【respond】 to changes in their habitat. These observations help them develop new theories about life. Many of these studies are 【experimental】 in nature, involving controlled tests to explore new ideas. This approach helps advance our knowledge of the natural world.

112.Sustainable Practices Around the World. 全球可持续实践

In today's world, eco-friendly practices can be found 【everywhere】 as people become more aware of environmental issues. Many industries are adopting green technologies to reduce their carbon footprint. These 【sustainable】 solutions, such as solar panels and reusable materials, are now widely used in daily life. They help protect the planet for future generations. The 【application】 of these technologies shows how innovation can support a healthier environment. This trend is expected to grow even further.
