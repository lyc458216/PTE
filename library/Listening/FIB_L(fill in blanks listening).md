1.Laurence Stephen Lowry. 劳伦斯·斯蒂芬·劳瑞

Lowry is famous for painting scenes of life in the 【industrial】 districts of North West England in the mid-20th century. He developed a 【distinctive】 style of painting and is best known for his urban landscapes peopled with human figures often referred to as 【matchstick】 man. He painted mysterious unpopulated landscapes, brooding 【portraits】 and the unpublished"marionette" works, which were only found after his death.

2.William Shakespeare. 威廉·莎士比亚

For all his fame and celebration, William Shakespeare remains a 【mysterious】 figure with regards to personal history. There are just two primary 【sources】 for information on the Bard: his works, and various legal and 【church】 documents that have survived from Elizabethan times. Naturally, there are many 【gaps】 in this body of information, which tells us little about Shakespeare the man.

3.CEO. 首席执行官

That brings us to the CEO's second duty: building 【everyone】 or more accurately, building the senior team. All the executives report to the CEO, so it's the CEO's job to 【hire】, fire, and manage the executive team. From 【coaching】 CEOs, I actually think this is the most important skill of all. Because when a CEO hires an excellent senior team, that team can keep the company running. when a CEO hire a poor senior team, the CEO is up 【spending】 all of their time trying to do with the team, and not nearly enough time trying to do with other elements of their job. The senior team can and often does 【develop】 the strategy for the company, but ultimately it's always the CEO who has the final"go- no- go" decision on strategy.

6.Getting bored in class. 上课走神

A majority of U. S. high school students say they get 【bored】 in class every day, and more than one out of 【five】 has considered dropping out, according to a survey released on Wednesday. The survey of 81, 000 students in 【twenty-six】 states found two-thirds of high school students complain of boredom, usually because the subject matter was 【irrelevant】 or their teachers didn't seem to care about them.

7.Bar code scanners. 条形码扫描器

Many different types of bar code scanning machines exist, but they all work on the same fundamental principles. They all use the 【intensity】 of light reflected from a series of black and white stripes to tell a computer what code it is 【seeing】. White stripes reflect light very well, while black stripes reflect hardly any light at all. The bar code scanner shines light 【sequentially】 across a bar code, simultaneously detecting and recording the pattern of reflected and non-reflected light. The scanner then 【translates】 this pattern into an electrical signal that the computer can understand. All scanners must include computer software to interpret the bar code once it's been entered. This simple principle has transformed the way we are able to 【manipulate】 data and the way in which many businesses handle recordkeeping.

8.H1N1. 甲型H1N1流感

9.Integrated ticketing. 综合票务系统

Well in 2004 we integrated ticketing in South East Queensland, so we have 【introduced】 a paper ticket that allowed you to travel across all the three 【modes】 in South East Queensland, so bus, train and 【ferry】, and the second stage of integrated ticketing is the introduction of a Smart Card, and the Smart Card will enable people to 【store】 value so to put value on the card, and then to use the card for 【traveling】 around the system.

10.Neo-Latin. 新拉丁语

Those of you who've never heard the term 【neo-Latin】, may be forgiven for thinking it's a new South American dance craze. If you're 【puzzled】 when I tell you it has something to do with the language of Romans, take heart, over the years many classes I know have 【confessed】 they are not really sure what it is either. Some have 【assumed】 that they are so-called' Late-Latin', written at the end of the Roman Empire. Others have supposed it must have something to do with the middle ages. Or perhaps it's that 【pseudo-Latin】 which my five and seven-year-old boys seem to have 【gleaned】 from the Harry Potter books, useful for spells and curses that they zip one another with makeshift paper ash ones. No, in fact, neo-Latin is more or less the same as the Latin that was written in the 【ancient】 world, classical Latin. So, what's so new about it?

11.Rammer. 夯土机

12.Traffic jam. 交通堵塞

For the first time, Japanese researchers have conducted a real-life experiment that shows how some traffic jams appear for no apparent reason. They placed the 22 vehicles on a 【single】 track, and asked the drivers to cruise around at a constant speed of 30 kilometers an hour. At first, traffic moves smoothly, but soon, the distance between cars started to 【vary】, and vehicles clumped together at one point on the track, but the jams 【spread】 backward around the track, like a shockwave at a rate of about 20 kilometers an hour. Real-life jams move backward at about the same speed.

13.Water crisis. 水危机

Now that story's been scotched, as only part of contingency planning. But it was a symptom of the dramatic turn of events in South Australia, and it flushed out other remarks from water 【academics】 and people like Tim Flannery, indicating that things were really much worse than had been 【foreshadowed】, even earlier this year. So is Adelaide, let alone some whole 【regions】 of South Australia, in serious bother? Considering that the vast majority of its drinking water comes from the 【beleaguered】 Murray, something many of us outside the State may not have quite realized. Is their 【predicament】 something we have to face up to as a nation?

14.Difference. 差异

The effect of the first difference is, on the one hand, to refine and 【enlarge】 the public views, by passing them through the 【medium】 of a chosen body of citizens, whose 【wisdom】 may best discern the true interest of their country, and whose 【patriotism】 and love of justice will be least likely to sacrifice it to temporary or 【partial】 considerations.

15.E-Library. 电子图书馆

16.Planting bananas. 香蕉种植

17.Chemical technology. 化学技术

The ocean has been getting bluer, according to a study published in the journal Nature. But that's not really good news for the PLANET. It means that the plants that give the ocean its GREEN tint aren't doing well. Scientists say that's because the ocean has been getting WARMER.

18.The ocean gets warm. 海洋变暖

The ocean has been getting bluer, according to a study published in the journal Nature. But that's not really good news for the 【planet】. It means that the plants that give the ocean its 【green】 tint aren't doing well. Scientists say that's because the ocean has been getting 【warmer】.

19.Contract patterns generator. 合同模板生成器

In animals, a movement is coordinated by a cluster of neurons in the spinal cord called the central contract patterns generator, CPG. This produces signals that drive muscles to 【contract】 rhythmically in a way that produces running or walking, depending on the 【pattern】 of pulses. A simple signal from the brain instructs the CPG to switch between 【modes】 such as going from a standstill to walking.

20.Beautiful buildings. 美丽建筑

Along the way, we have built 【unashamedly】 beautiful buildings, two of which have won and been runner- up in the prestigious United Nations World 【Habitat】 Award: the first time an Australian building has received that international honor. We rely on older 【concepts】 of Australian architecture that are heavily influenced by the bush. All residents have private 【verandas】 which allows them to 【socialize】 outdoors and also creates some"defensible space" between their bedrooms and public areas. We use a lot of 【natural】 or soft materials and build beautiful landscaped gardens.

21.Financial markets. 金融市场

Financial markets swung wildly yesterday in frenzied trading market by further selling of 【equities】 and 【fears】 about an unraveling of the global carry trade. At the same time trading in the European credit markets in London was exceptionally 【heavy】 as traders frantically reassessed their appetite for risk, prompting wild swings in the prices of the key derivatives. It was the third day of frenetic 【activity】 in the European credit markets, suggesting that equity market 【swings】 were prompting a wider repositioning of investors in a host of asset classes.

22.Oceanographer. 海洋学家

For many years the favorite 【horror】 story about 【abrupt】 climate change was that a shift in ocean currents could 【radically】 cool Europe's climate. These currents, called the overturning 【circulation】 bring warm water and warm temperatures north from the equator to Europe. Susan Loosier, an 【oceanographer】 at Duke University, says scientists have long worried that this ocean circulation could be disrupted.

23.Nanotechnology. 纳米技术

What is nanotechnology? Well, a report that was put together by a 【combination】 of the Royal Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering that came out last summer, 【identified】 two topics. Nano-science is the study of 【phenomena】 and the manipulation of materials at atomic, molecular and 【macromolecular】 scales, where properties differ significantly from those as a larger scale. Nanotechnologies are the design characterization, production and application of 【structures】, devices and systems by controlling shape and size at the nanometer scale. So I'll talk a little bit more in a moment about what a nanometer is, but 【loosely】 speaking people think of nanotechnologies as being a sort of a hundred nanometers or less.

24.Virus. 病毒

So a virus is something that you can't see by normal light microscopy, you need very advanced 【techniques】 for electron microscopy to see it, but that virus is not able to reproduce itself without a host and us as human beings are made up of lots of different cell 【types】 and we are interested in understanding at the molecular level how that virus infects the liver and why does it infect the liver and it doesn't infect the heart or it doesn't infect other 【tissues】.

25.Sea levels. 海平面

If sea levels continue to rise, eventually the property becomes 【inundated】 and the real value of the property, the vast bulk of its value will be in the value of the land, which of course is then unusable. And that's of course not 【ensured】 by proper insurance. Landowners and banks and other financial institutions that have lent money against the value of those 【properties】 are going to find that they suffer very serious losses and it's not at all obvious at the moment who would 【compensate】 them.

26.Tax increases. 税收增加

Working together, they figured out that if the government was going to propose some kinds of significant tax increases, which is a good 【strategy】, require me to at least lie something like 【getting】 something for those big tax brackets, not seeing any results. So the result of that was in the 【package】 of legislation that included the tax increases. There was awesome information to have significant 【expansion】 of coverage families where they can buy into their private 【insurance】.

27.Carbon-rich soil. 富碳土壤

Rebuilding carbon- rich agriculture soils is the only real productive, 【permanent】 solution to taking excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. She's 【frustrated】 that scientists and politicians don't see the same opportunities she sees. This year, Australia will 【emit】 just over 600 million tons of carbon. We can sequester 685 million tons of carbon by 【increasing】 soil carbon by half a percent on only 2 percent of the farms. If we increased it on all of the farms, we could sequester the 【whole】 world's emissions of carbon.

28.Housing market. 住房市场

Well, Alex, the National Association of Realtors is at least putting the champagne on ice. The industry group says the 【slight】 rise in sales for previously owned homes shows the housing market is finally stabilizing, which is the first sign of a recovery. Now, that of course is an interpretation of the 【numbers】 Alex, and one that's coming from an organization known for being somewhat of a cheerleader for the housing market, since its members are made up of 【realtors】 who've been losing a lot of money in the slump. Now, for a more 【sober】 view, I talked to Wellesley housing economist Karl Case, and he says the slight uptick in sales hardly 【offsets】 the fact that numbers are down 20 percent from the year before.

29.Young people's choices. 年轻人的选择

I think its really important for young people not to feel 【restricted】 in their choices and also to be aware of the choices that are available to them and obviously the media has an 【incredibly】 important role to play in that. I think we 【tend】 to talk about science as this big kind of monolith but of course, actually, it's this beautiful multifaceted thing. You know, there's almost something for everybody there. And there are so many different 【aspects】 of it. You know, somebody that's going to be attracted to working in biology might be a very different person from somebody who's attracted to engineering. I suppose it's about knowing the breadth of 【opportunities】 that are out there and so anything that universities and broadcast media can do to make sure that those opportunities are visible.

30.The entrepreneurs. 企业家

Why do we need more entrepreneurs right now? The entrepreneurs who create and run our businesses, who play by the rules, are in fact 【critical】 to our success as a nation. We need them especially today. Business, not government, will end this 【recession】. Government must help by creating fair rules, sound monetary policy, and by protecting our fellow citizens in periods when they are 【jobless】. We have to make way for the new entrepreneurial firms that will push us to frontiers of 【innovation】.

31.Economists. 经济学家

An economist sees the world basically through a typical micro-economic 【toolkit】. That involves things like thinking at the margin, rationality, opportunity cost, trade-offs. Economists like any other 【discipline】, rules, and its own way of seeing the world. So basically economics, or economists in general tend to apply 【micro-economic】 【concepts】 like that to explain the way humans behave and to make 【predictions】 about the future.

32.Mixed and unmixed liquids. 混合与未混合液体

Finally, we take a look at how to mix and unmix 【liquids】 at the flick of a switch. Sandrine tells us more. Oil and water don't usually mix, but the new chemical sensitive to light has been added here to 【blend】 them together. When 【exposed】 to UV light, the chemical changes its structure and becomes soluble in water. This causes two layers to form with the oil floating on top of the water chemical combo. This method should be cheaper than the current 【alternative】 which involves using high energy centrifuges.

33.British Library. 大英图书馆

To begin with, you should be standing in the main 【floor】 of the British Library. British Library situated in the Euston road next to some pipe crustacean press, in the foyer to the left of the 【information】 desk. It was a large white staircase. Follow this up towards the gallery at the top of the 【stairs】, pause and look to your left for attention. This is Robert Cotton, born in 1570, and died in 1631. Cotton was a member of parliament but he's mainly known as a great antiquarian 【collector】 of manuscripts. It is the covenant we have a great depth and the survival of many English manuscripts.

34.Investors confidence. 投资者信心

Higher interest rates have knocked investors 【confidence】 in putting their money into property, evidence suggests. The 【insurance】 company standard life says that the rate rises since last summer have led more people to question the wisdom of property investment.

35.Environment problems. 环境问题

Environment problems caused by hard rock mining involve water pollution by metals themselves, chemicals used in processing, acid 【drainage】, and sediment. Metals and metal-like elements in the ore are toxic and prone to cause trouble by ending up in nearby streams and water tables as a result of mining operations.

36.Van Gogh's sunflowers. 梵高的向日葵

These two paintings, both called sunflowers are generally accepted as the finest of several 【depictions】 of the thick-stemmed, nodding blooms that Van Gogh made in 1889 during his time in Arles. The first is now in the collection of the National Gallery in London, and the second is in the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. Van Gogh referred to this work as a"【repetition】" of the London painting. But art historians and curators have long been 【curious】 to know how different this"repetition" is from the first. Should it be considered a copy, an independent artwork or something in between? An 【extensive】 research project conducted over the past three years by conservation experts at both the National Gallery and Van Gogh Museum has concluded that the second painting was"not intended as an exact copy of the 【original】 example," said Ella Hendriks, a professor of conservation and restoration at the University of Amsterdam, who was the lead researcher on the project.

37.Cars in America. 美国汽车

There are some 250 million cars in America, 250 million cars in the country with just over 300 million people. And most of those vehicles, of course, are gas 【powered】. This poses a huge challenge given the limited supplies of oil and the growing 【urgency】 of the global warming crisis. But there is good news, according to our guests today. And that is we have the know-how and the technology to build 【sleek】, fast automobiles that don't use gasoline. These vehicles of tomorrow are powered by 【hydrogen】, electricity, bio-fuels, and digital technology. And they already exist. So what's stopping us from putting them on the roads? Our guests today will help answer that.

38.Facial expression. 面部表情

Is that person really glad to see me? Or are they just 【being】 polite? Some people struggle to distinguish a 【fake】 grin from a truly happy smile. And computers have found this task even more difficult, that is, until researchers 【develop】 a program to detect when a smile is genuine. Visual computing researchers at the University of Bradford in the U. K. started with software for 【simulating】 a changing facial expression. This program can examine a video clip of a human head and identify specific 【details】 around the eyes, cheeks and mouth. Then the program tracks the details moving relative to each other as the face smiles. Next, the scientists had their program 【analyzing】 two sets of video clips. In one, subjects performed posed smiles.

39.Kimbell. 金贝尔（美术馆）

The first section of the book covers new modes of assessment. In Chapter 1, Kimbell, Goldsmith College, London responds to 【criticisms】 of design programs as formalistic and conventional, stating that a focus on risk-taking than hard work in design innovation is equally problematic. His research contains three parts that include preliminary exploration of design innovation qualities, investigation of resulting classroom practices, and development of the evidence-based assessment. The assessment he describes is presented in the form of a structured worksheet, which includes a collaborative 【element】 and digital photographs, in story format. Such a device encourages stimulating ideas but does not recognize students as design 【innovators】. The assessment sheet includes holistic impressions as well as details about"having, growing, and proving" ideas. 【Colloquial】 judgments are evident in terms such as"wow" and"yawn" and reward the quality and quantity of ideas with the term,"sparkiness," which fittingly is a pun as the model project was to design light bulb packaging. In addition, the assessment focuses on the process of optimizing or complexity control as well as proving ideas with thoughtful criticism and not just generation of novel ideas. The definitions for qualities such as"technical" and"esthetic" pertaining to users are too narrow and ill-defined. The author provides 【examples】 of the project, its features and structures, students' notes and judgments, and their sketches and photographs of finished light bulb packages, in the Appendix.

40.Social harm. 社会危害

Social harm originates out of a series of 【debates】 within criminology about the narrowness of the definition of crime, that essentially, focuses on individual acts of harm, things like inter-personal violence, theft, so on and so forth. So the idea of social harm 【originally】 was to expand that notion of harm to encompass the harms that organizations and nation-states cause. But battery the idea of social harm really now transcends criminology so there are a group of 【writers】 who think that and I would include myself there, that actually there's something to social harm that could be very useful in term of trying to understand the harms that 【occur】 within society, to produce an objective and well-rounded analyzes of harm.

41.Candace Galen. 坎迪斯·盖伦

Candace Galen is based at the University of Missouri, in Columbia. And, being a biologist, she thought, why not use this astronomical 【phenomenon】 to study a biological one? Specifically: as the skies 【darken】 would daytime pollinators, like bumblebees and honeybees, call it 【quits】?"What better activity during an eclipse than to go out with a recorder and record the bees?"" So Galen asked 400 citizen scientists, including young students, to place audio recorders in 16 flower patches along the path of totality, in Oregon, Idaho and Missouri. When they analyzed the audio, they found that during 【partial】 eclipse, bee buzzing continued. But when totality hit, the bees went silent and only the conversational buzz of human observers could be heard. Then, as the moon passed and the sun again lit up the sky, the bees 【regained】 their buzz.

42.Green chemistry. 绿色化学

Green chemistry is a concept designed to develop 【technologies】 which allow chemistry to be practiced with minimal damage to the environment, or in an environmentally 【compatible】 way, and it's meant to cover both chemical processes and chemical 【products】. The center was set up about seven or eight years ago. And the idea was to provide a hub of activities that covered 【fundamental】 research work, international collaboration, but also educational development on public 【understanding】 of the project as well, and also networking so we network out to well over 1000 people around the globe.

43.Weather change. 天气变化

What I'm trying to understand and what other 【colleagues】 of mine are trying to understand, is how we moved from that cold climate condition to the warm climate condition that we enjoy today. We know from ice core research that the 【transition】 from these cold 【conditions】 to warm conditions wasn't smooth, as you might predict from the slow increase in solar radiation. And we know this from ice cores, because if you drill down into ice, you find annual bands of ice, and you can see this in the iceberg. You can see those blue-white layers. Gases are 【trapped】 in the ice cores, so we can measure CO2 that's why we know CO2 was lower in the past and the chemistry of the ice also tells us about the 【temperature】 in the polar regions.

44.Corals. 珊瑚

The way I look back in the past is by using the fossilized remains of 【deep-water】 corals. You can see an image of one of these corals behind me. It was collected from close to 【Antarctica】, thousands of meters below the sea, so, very different than the kinds of corals you may have been 【lucky】 enough to see if you've had a tropical holiday. So I'm hoping that this talk will give you a four-dimensional view of the 【ocean】. Two dimensions, such as this beautiful two-dimensional image of the sea surface 【temperature】. This was taken using a satellite, so it's got 【tremendous】 spatial resolution. The overall features are 【extremely】 easy to understand. The equatorial regions are warm because there's more sunlight. The polar regions are cold because there's less sunlight. And that allows big 【ice-caps】 to build up on Antarctica and up in the Northern Hemisphere.

45.Phone users. 手机用户

You know, without getting into the details of 【exactly】 how that happened or who she got it out, let's just say it was a bad situation. And she panicked because, like for many of us, her phone is one of the most used and 【essential】 tools in her life. But, on the other hand, she had no idea how to fix it, because it's a completely 【mysterious】 black box. So, think about it: what would you do? What do you really understand about how your phone works? What are you willing to test or fix? For most people, the answer is, nothing. In fact, one survey found that almost 80 percent of smartphone users in this country have never even replaced their phone 【batteries】, and 25 percent didn't even know this is 【possible】.

46.Radio telescope. 射电望远镜

Perhaps you've seen pictures of the 【large】 array of, you know, those radio telescopes in New Mexico, scanning the skies for 【intelligent】 life in the movie contact life Well radiant astronomers have caused to 【celebrate】 the first phase of a giant new Radio Telescope Array went 【operational】 in Northern California, it's going to help astronomers study things like black holes and dark 【galaxies】. All the while scanning the stars for, who knows, radio 【signals】 coming from somewhere else in the universe. Maybe ET is phoning home.

47.Earth warming. 地球变暖

The earth is warming. Almost all the Arctic 【summer】 ice may have melted by the end of the century, claims the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change the IPCC. The upside. 【Access】 to an estimated quarter of the world's oil and gas resources and the 【opening】 of the fabled Northwest Passage. The downside. The Arctic wilderness is lost as 【neighboring】 countries, Denmark and Greenland, Russia, Canada, Norway, and the United States all race to 【share】 in the bounty.

48.Interesting sound. 有趣的声音

I would have guessed a Wild West performer was 【practicing】 with a bullwhip while also vacuuming. But no. That sound is apparently produced by the aurora borealis, the northern lights. Since 2000 researchers at Finland's Aalto University have been 【collecting】 audio, as part of what's called the Auroral Acoustics project. Folk tales have long held that the lights also produce odd sounds, but the claims were hard to prove. And some researchers thought that any noises produced by the 【energetic】 particles, that cause the light show would be far too high in the sky to be heard on the ground. But the latest results indicate that at least some sounds are produced very close to the ground. A setup of three ground-based 【microphones】 allowed researchers to estimate that the sounds occur perhaps just 70 meters up. The results were just presented at the International Congress on Sound and Vibration in Vilnius, Lithuania. More information about the sounds of the northern lights could lead to a more complete understanding of the 【phenomenon】. So if you see an aurora, keep your ears open.

49.Auditory sensitivity. 听觉敏感性

Have you ever wanted to turn down the volume at a deafening 【concert】 or noisy bar? Envy the whale: a new study finds that toothed whales can reduce their own auditory sensitivity when they expect a loud sound. The work is presented at this week's Acoustics 2012 meeting. Whales and dolphins rely on their responsive hearing to interpret returning echolocation 【clicks】. Previous research suggested that these marine mammals could dull their hearing before uttering outgoing echolocation clicks, which are very loud. Could they use the same coping mechanism for 【external】 noises? To find out, researchers trained a false killer whale that a loud noise would always follow a brief warning signal. Then, they attached suction cup sensors to the outside of the whale's head and played the 【signal】. The sensors 【measured】 brainwaves that indicated the whale did reduce its hearing sensitivity in expectation of a clamor. The researchers hope to test other species as well. Loud noises from ships can disturb whales. To accommodate 【marine】 life, perhaps vessels could emit signals before making a ruckus, warning whales to tune us out.

50.Online dating. 在线约会

Bruch and her colleague Mark Newman studied who swapped messages with whom on a popular online dating platform in the month of January 2014. They 【categorized】 users by desirability using PageRank, one of the algorithms behind search 【technology】. Essentially, if you receive a dozen messages from desirable users, you must be more desirable than someone who receives the same number of messages from average users. Then they asked: How far"out of their league" do online daters tend to go when pursuing a partner?"I think people are optimistic 【realists】." In other words, they found that both men and women tended to pursue mates just 25 percent more desirable than themselves."So they're being optimistic, but they're also taking into account their own relative position within this overall desirability 【hierarchy】." And the study did have a few more lessons for people on the market:"I think one of the take-home messages from this study is that women could probably afford to be more aspirational in their 【mate】 pursuit."

51.Pharmaceutical industry. 制药行业

It is about a hundred years since the great Canadian-born physician Sir William Osler, Regius Professor of Medicine in Oxford, 【complained】 about the increasing influence of the pharmaceutical industry on the medical 【profession】. He would be turning in his grave at the way the 【industry】 now dominates doctors' 【prescribing】 habits. It does this not only by direct and indirect pressure on the doctors themselves, but also by 【encouraging】 the public to ask for scripts.

52.Almonds. 杏仁

And one particular crop, almond in the US and now in Australia, is 【transforming】 the world of beekeeping and of bees. What has happened is that something serendipitous came along that people found out, that doctors found out that almonds are good for you, a 【confection】, but it's good for you. The Almond Board got a very aggressive promotion going on for almonds. They actually, I just heard recently, send out sales reps to 【cardiologists】 at hospitals to promote the heart benefits of almonds. In a very good promotion of almonds, and it's 【legitimate】 promotion because they are a healthy food.

53.Drop in share prices. 股价下跌

Well, the simple explanation might be that yesterday's 【sudden】 drop in share prices pretty much across the board has created what market analysts like to call a buying opportunity. It tends to bring out investors to pick through the ruins, looking for 【bargains】. Decision by investors that sellers got a little carried away with things so the buyers have 【lifted】 all the major indexes today. The Dow, the NASDAQ, the S&P 500 were all up around half a percent in early trading today, and that wasn't a big surprise. The sell-off continued somewhat 【overseas】. European markets remain fairly weak, along with many of the Asian markets. But you'll remember that all this started with a big 【plunge】 of around 9 percent on the stock market in Shanghai. Well, Chinese rebounded by around 4 percent.
