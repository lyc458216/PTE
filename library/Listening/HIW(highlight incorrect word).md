1.Height. 身高/高度  

Height is correlated with a lot of things. Up to a certain height, taller people make more money than the 【flatly】 challenged. And the taller 【residential】 candidate almost always wins. Now a study finds that your height as an adult has a profound effect on your perception of your health. Short people judge their health to be worse than average or tall people judge theirs. The research was published in the journal Clinical Endocrinology.
Data for the study came from the 2003 Health Survey for England. More than 14, 000 participants filled out 【questions】 and had their heights measured. The study only looked at how good the subject through his or her health was, not their actual health.
Questions focused on five areas: mobility, self-care, normal activities, pain or 【disgrace】 and anxiety or depression. Men shorter than about 5'4 and women shorter than 5' reported the worst impressions. But small increases in height at the low end had much bigger effects on perception than the same increase among taller people. Other studies have shown, ironically, that shorter people on average actually live longer.

2.What's an article?. 什么是文章？  

What's an article? I was asking myself this very question in the post office yesterday, standing in line waiting to sign for, as it so happens, an article. A postal article. Not the postal article. Now before we get ahead of ourselves, an article in English is a 【verb】 that precedes a noun, and simply indicates specificity. This sounds quite complicated, and to be honest, it's quite complicated to say without spraying everyone within 15 feet, but the concept's quite simple. The definite article in English is the word"the", and indicates a specific thing or type; for example, the train is an hour late. By contrast, the indefinite article in English is any of the words"a","an" or"some", and the indefinite article indicates a non- specific thing; for example, would you please pass me an apple. We always precede a word with"a" if it doesn't start with a vowel sound. For example, take a hike; I'm spending a Weekend at Burnie's or there's a Knight in Shining Armour. Similarly, we 【process】 words with the indefinite article"an" if they do start with a vowel sound, for example, an ostrich, an 【enlarged】 mess or an Occupational Health and Safety Policy.

3.Australia's greenhouse gases. 澳大利亚的温室气体  

It's basically all the same thing. A 【generous】 plan to cut back Australia's greenhouse gases. And we are, per capita the biggest carbon polluters on the 【globe】. But it's not carbon trading that will make the first big cuts will come from the Governments 【reduced】 energy target. Melbourne-based 【company】 Carbon Market Economics says the Governments 20 percent 【policy】 will not only cut pollution, it'll help the economy as well.

4.Biobonanza. 生物繁荣（或生物资源热潮）  

BioBonanza is a one-day open-house festival. All of the researchers in the Department of Biology are going to be showcasing their research so 【scholars】 can come and see research, interact with the researchers. And we want people to be able to interact and have fun at this event. As soon as you walk 【through】 the doors, you'll see all sorts of activities, 【images】 of how a human heart works. We'll have 【segments】 of spinal cord and brain. You'll get to be able to see 【moths】 and all sorts of insects. You'll be able to try to catch some local insects and we'll have activities like 【wandering】 through local plant gardens and seeing how photosynthesis work.

5.Definitions of happiness. 幸福的定义  

There have been various definitions of happiness throughout history and the history of 【psychology】, the ones which interest me are 【attitudes】 to happiness that follow the Enlightenment, particularly in the work of Jeremy Bentham, for whom happiness was really a combination of physical 【sensations】, pleasures as different combinations and aggregations of pleasure and pain occur over time. They 【create】 these psychological experiences that Bentham called happiness. But underlying them for Bentham were physical triggers and 【elements】.

6.Cumulative culture. 累积性文化  

They may be our cousins, but orangutans and other primates are nowhere near humans in terms of technological 【accomplishment】, social organisation or culture. As humans, capacity for building off one another, an 【interesting】 part of our so called cumulative culture that has allowed us to build up so much in so little time. But how do we develop such 【accurate】 methods of learning in the first place? Kevin Leyland of the University of St Andrews spoke with me about his team's quest to pinpoint the social and 【cultural】 process that underlie humans ability to acquire and 【transfer】 knowledge.

7.Human life support systems. 人类生命支持系统  

Dramatic changes in human life support systems took place in the modern world over the last 500 years. Human 【populations】 during this time period reached unprecedented sizes and growth rates. Global migrations introduced exotic plants, animals, 【diseases】, technologies and cultural beliefs throughout the world. The Industrial Revolution and its aftermath transformed 【ecosystems】 on an unparalleled scale and intensity. Urban 【places】 exploded in number and size during the period and large- scale social systems emerged that were tied together by networks of economic exchange, 【production】 and communication.

8.Written Assessment. 书面评估  

We're going to have a short written assessment which will happen every fortnight. You will all be 【broken】 up into small groups, so feel free to ask any questions as I go along. And we'll also ask you to participate. So if you'd all like to open your books to page one.

9.Experimental Scientist. 实验科学家  

What we are going to find out today is how it's a bit more 【complicated】 than that, which it always is. I think it's really 【wonderful】. I mean, not being an experimental scientist myself, I have a kind of 【envy】 at the way in which science can continue to 【surprise】 us by this. People working away in labs, moving on our 【understanding】 in ways. Hugo is a cognitive scientist at the French National Centre for Scientific Research. Hugo Mercier.

10.Sotheby. 苏富比（拍卖行）  

The world has changed. The economics of the world have changed, and the art market has come in behind that. Absolutely, and it is part of the reason why Christie's left Australia and no longer has an office here. And Sotheby, it's basically a branch or a 【franchise】, for want of a better word of Sotheby's International. So neither auction 【house】 has a really permanent international 【presence】 in Australia because they are focusing their attention on the places they can make money, which is the Middle East, India and Asia.

11.Practicality of Employment. 就业实用性  

Now, a professor is also a member of a profession, presumably one 【comprising】 people who see their discipline as a vocation in its full sense of vocation from vocare to call is a 【calling】. Despite some modern 【usage】 which reduce it to the practicalities of employment practise and not theory, the product of training, not education or vocation is 【more】 than this. A calling is active as well as passive. It implies a 【sense】 of purpose. There is a 【guilty】 to be vocal.

12.Divide the Ward. 划分病房（或行政选区）  

The idea is that we divide the ward- the patients if you like- and the nurses into three different teams, which we call 【lively】 nursing teams. And in those teams we then have the primary nurse which is myself, associate nurses which 【might】 tend to be D grade nurses, and health care 【officials】, and you're all in one team together. The idea is that you would hopefully work as a team in co-ordinating the care for the patients who come in under your care as in the red team. In our teams we have eight patients each. The idea would be that I would 【always】 prescribe the care or plan the care, for those patients. In reality, it doesn't always work like that and besides which the associate nurses that are in the teams have those skills anyway from their 【upgrading】.

13.Ending Poverty. 消除贫困  

For some people, this 【presentation】 may seem far fetched, but ending poverty is both 【ethically】 necessary and actually feasible. All of us must play a role in making it happen. All human beings want, and have a 【way】 to live in dignity, to determine our own destinies, and to be respected by other, by other people. Despite the universality of 【three】 rights, our capacities to fulfil them vary enormously, and no 【divining】 line is more profound in influencing the quality of our lives than the gulf between poverty and prosperity.

14.Incredible Thing about Quantum Mechanics. 量子力学的奇妙之处  

You know that the incredible thing about quantum mechanics were many incredible things, but one of them, at least to me, is that it really works. It is the 【science】 of the universe. It describes what's going on here on Earth, that it describes what happens in the early universe. That Andre's studies. And so when we think about how those building blocks that Leon was just 【discussing】 fit together to make the world around us are we use quantum mechanics to describe atoms, nuclei, molecules, light. It is the theory of the world. And so it's not surprising that we see it in many everyday 【happenings】 and many everyday applications. An example might be the lasers that you see in a compact disc 【machine】 or the supermarket scanner.

15.Diabetes and Blood Pressure. 糖尿病与血压  

No that was, and that's an important aspect, as you 【referred】 to earlier we've previously done work which has proven that in some 【circumstances】, even people whose blood pressure is not high, can benefit from blood pressure- lowering 【rehabilitation】. So in this study the main reason that we included the patients was because of diabetes, we didn't care what their blood pressure was, whether it was high or low. And our 【intention】 was to see whether or not lowering average or below average blood pressure in diabetics was beneficial and the 【effect】 suggested that irrespective of whether your blood pressure was high or low, if you had diabetes you 【profited】.

16.Future of a Photon. 光子的未来  

Oh, it's very spooky. First of all, probability by itself is spooky. Let me show you how probability enters the 【sample】. You walk past a store window and you see an image of yourself in the store window, you straighten the part, not so bad you know, for a man of my age. The guy in the store window who's fooling around with mannequins he sees you and you see yourself. What does that mean? A 【beam】 of photons from sunlight leaves your face, heads for the store window- let's consider one of them. It has a choice: it can go right through, so that the guy behind the window can see you, or it can be reflected from the store window. Some 【actions】 of them are reflected, and some of them go through. What determines that? What determines the future of that photon? And 【doubtless】 such examples teach us that it's random, that it's a 【roll】 of the dice, and that's where Einstein made his famous statement"God plays dice with the universe ." That every instant of that single object, that quantum object we have probability, we do not have certainty.

17.Archery. 射箭  

Archery, the practise or arts of shooting with a bow and arrow, has played an important part in English history, being the 【main】 weapon of the foot- soldier and instrumental in winning many battles in wars with the French- with whom we seemed to be 【constantly】 at war during the Middle Ages. The English 【favoured】 the longbow over the short bow and the crossbow, the latter being the main firearm of 【militaries】 on the European continent. The crossbow fired a metal bolt released by a trigger, rather like a gun, and had the 【longest】 range of any of the bows, but the main advantage of the longbow was its accuracy. The importance placed on archery is illustrated by the fact that mediaeval kings in England encouraged the practise and one of them, Edward the Third, went so far as to 【ban】 all sports on Sundays and holidays except archery. Because there were no standing armies in those days, and in the event of war rulers had to call on the populace, everything was done to make sure there were large numbers of competent, if not expert archers, to recruit.

18.G.M. Crops. 是 "Genetically Modified Crops" 的缩写，通用译法为“转基因作物”

One of the 【girth】 about working with genetically 【beside】 crops has been that vegetation growing in agricultural fields might escape out into the world. Now, for the first time in the U. S., researchers report a large population of GM crops beyond the farm. Transgenic canola plants in North Dakota had 【pedigreed】 genes making them resistant to herbicides, such as the weed killer Roundup. Researchers collected and tested 406 canola plants along thousands of miles of state roads. They found 347 carrying at least one resistance gene. There were also indications that the inserted genes were being passed on to new generations, producing some plants in the wild with multiple transgenes. The findings were presented on August 6 th at the annual meeting of the 【Archeological】 Society of America in Pittsburgh. The 【pinprick】 canola plants are not about to take over the world. But researchers are 【industriously】 curious about how these particular plants managed to make it in places like the edges of parking lots rather than pampered fields. Any answers they find will likely affect future biotechnology regulation.
