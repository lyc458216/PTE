3. 平稳与波动 (Stable & Variable)

4. 程度副词 (Adverbs - 增加分数关键)

四、 极值与比较 (Extremes & Comparisons)
用于柱状图（Bar Chart）和饼图（Pie Chart）抓重点。
英文单词/词组	中文解释	例句用法
The highest figure	最高的数据	"The highest figure can be found in..."
The lowest value	最低的数值	
Maximum / Minimum	最大值 / 最小值	
The majority of	绝大多数	饼图常用
The minority of	极少数	
Account for / Comprise	占据 / 构成	"Water accounts for 50%..."
In contrast	相反 / 相比之下	连接两个相反的数据
Is followed by	紧随其后的是...	描述第二名时用
Gap / Difference	差距	"The gap between A and B..."
Overlap	重叠	韦恩图或特定图表

五、 地图与流程图专用 (Maps & Flowcharts)
这两类图比较特殊，需要方位词和顺序词。
1. 地图 (Maps)
Northern / Southern Hemisphere: 北半球 / 南半球
Equator: 赤道
Latitude / Longitude: 纬度 / 经度
Located / Situated in: 位于...
Coastal area / Inland area: 沿海地区 / 内陆地区
Top left / Bottom right: 左上角 / 右下角
2. 流程图 (Flowcharts)
First step / Initial stage: 第一步 / 初始阶段
Subsequent step: 接下来的步骤
Process / Cycle: 过程 / 循环
Convert into / Transform into: 转化为...
Finally / Eventually: 最后

六、 必备套话模版词 (Templates & Connectors)
为了保证流利度，这些词可以帮你填补思考的空白。
开场:
"The graph gives information about..." (这张图提供了关于...的信息)
"As we can see from the image..." (正如我们从图中看到的)
连接:
"Furthermore / Moreover" (此外)
"On the other hand" (另一方面)
"Moving to the next point" (转到下一点)
结尾:
"In conclusion" (总而言之)
"Overall, the trend is clear." (总体来看，趋势很明显)
💡 给你的备考小贴士：
不要纠结语法：DI主要看流利度（Fluency），时态错了或者单复数错了不要停下来改，继续说！
看到什么说什么：如果你突然忘了“X轴”怎么说，直接读X轴上的标题（比如 Time, Year）即可。
数字读法：
1990: Nineteen ninety
2005: Two thousand and five
25%: Twenty-five percent
$100: One hundred dollars (记得加s)
希望这份清单对你有帮助！如果需要具体的模版，也可以告诉我。

PTE考试中，DI（Describe Image）评分的核心逻辑是：流利度 (Fluency) > 发音 (Pronunciation) > 内容 (Content)。
也就是说，说的顺畅、不停顿、不卡壳，比你分析得深奥重要得多。
为您总结了3个最实用、最易背的“万能模板”，分别针对数据图（柱状、饼状、线图）和非数据图（地图、照片、流程图）。

模板一：数据万能版 (最推荐，适用于90%的图表)
【适用】：柱状图 (Bar)、饼图 (Pie)、线图 (Line)、表格 (Table)。
【核心逻辑】：找最大值、最小值、读标题。
第一句 (Introduction):
The following graph gives information about [读标题].
(这张图提供了关于...的信息)
第二句 (Highest):
According to the graph, the highest figure is [最大值的名称], which is [具体数字].
(根据图表，最高的数据是...，数值是...)
第三句 (Lowest):
On the other hand, the lowest figure is [最小值的名称], which is [具体数字].
(另一方面，最低的数据是...，数值是...)
结尾 (Conclusion Trend):
In conclusion, it is clear that [名称A] is higher than [名称B].
*(很明显，A比B要高) —— 如果找不到具体数据，这句话可以用来凑时间
💡 使用技巧：
只要把括号里的词替换掉，其他部分像念经一样背熟，保持语速匀速即可。

模板二：无脑列举版 ( "I can see" 大法)
【适用】：地图 (Map)、照片 (Picture)、复杂的混合图、或者你实在看不懂图的时候。
【核心逻辑】：看到什么读什么，不要纠结语法。
第一句:
The image describes [读标题/或者图片主题].
主体部分 (排比句轰炸):
I can see [图中单词/物体 A].
I can see [图中单词/物体 B].
I can see [图中单词/物体 C].
I can see [颜色/形状/年份]. (例如: I can see blue and red; I can see 2024)
结尾:
In conclusion, the image is about [再读一遍标题].

💡 使用技巧：
PTE机器很吃这一套，因为它检测到了简单的语法结构和关键词。比如地图题，你就一直说 "I can see North America. I can see water. I can see mountains." 只要流利，分数会很高。
模板三：极简流利版 (针对基础较弱或容易卡顿的同学)
【适用】：所有图。
【核心逻辑】：减少思考，用最简单的句型串联关键词。
开头:
This graph shows [标题].
中间 (把图里的单词读出来):
There is [单词 A] and [单词 B].
There is also [单词 C] and [单词 D].
Also, the figures are increasing / decreasing. (如果是线图就加这句，不是就算了)
结尾:
Overall, the graph provides accurate data.

⚠️ 考试实战 3大原则 (救命稻草)
如果你卡住了：
千万不要说 "Uh..." 或者停下来。马上说一句万能废话："Also, I can see different numbers and colors." (我也能看到不同的数字和颜色)，然后赶紧找下一个词读。
如果你看不清数字：
不要纠结是 10.5 还是 10.6，直接读 10。大概准确即可，PTE不考你的视力。
时间控制：
DI 只有 40秒 录音时间。
最佳策略：说 25秒 - 35秒 左右说完点Next。没必要撑满40秒，说多错多。
一旦说完 "In conclusion..." 马上点 Next，不要等待。
建议练习方法：
挑一张图，先用中文大概过一遍（标题、最大、最小），然后套进【模板一】里试着说，练到不用过脑子就能蹦出 "The following graph gives information about..." 为止。
