1.Climate change. 气候变化  

You are given climate change as the field of study. Which area would you prefer? Explain why you pick this particular area of your study and give an example of the area you pick.

---
There is no doubt that climate change has sparked widespread discussion. Personally speaking, I prefer to choose global warming as my study area of climate change, as global warming plays a notable role in shaping individuals and society. First of all, climate change will not only benefit the government but also bring substantial advantages to individuals.
Specifically, climate change has the potential to significantly improve the quality of work, education, and personal life. This is clearly demonstrated by a study conducted by the University of Auckland, which found that over 76% of participants believed that climate change could greatly enhance their overall experience in both professional and personal settings. On the other hand, it is undeniable that climate change may pose certain challenges in today's rapidly evolving world.
Some argue that its misuse could lead to dependency or ethical concerns. However, these issues can be effectively managed through appropriate regulation and responsible use. According to the Australian government’s annual report, nearly 70% of citizens acknowledged a strong connection between climate change and global warming, suggesting that when used properly, its positive impacts can be maximized. In conclusion, based on the above discussion, I strongly prefer to study global warming as my study area of climate change.
To address related challenges, governments and companies must allocate adequate resources, while schools and families should work together to foster a supportive environment for the responsible and effective use of climate change.

Over the past few years, climate change has gradually attracted widespread public attention. When it comes to global warming, different people have different points of view. From my perspective, I firmly believe that global warming is seriously impacting on everyone's life and society. In this essay, I will analyse the reasons for global warming and suggest potential solutions.
To begin with, one significant driving cause of environmental impact is the rapid increase of global warming. It is essential to maintain a balance between natural resources and renewable energy. To be more specific, statistics show that the majority of people think global warming is causing growing temperatures and rising sea levels which will impact on our life in the future. Consequently, it is reasonable to argue that global warming is seriously impacting on everyone's life and society.
On the other hand, proponents of global warming contend that it is essential to consider societal factors. Climate change may seem a convenient option at first sight. However, it may lead to undesirable outcomes, if we think about societal factors thoroughly. Moreover, recent studies indicate that there is a close relationship between mental health well-being and the quality of life. Therefore, the urgency of emphasising climate change cannot be underestimated.
In summary, all these facts provide us with enough support for the idea that global warming is seriously impacting on everyone's life and society.

2.Daily inventions. 日常发明  

Talk about the pros and cons of this era as it is full of daily inventions. Any recent invention that you think proved beneficial or detrimental to society?

---
Nowadays, the controversial topic of modern inventions has drawn public attention and sparked widespread debates. From my perspective, I believe that the invention of computers is the most significant advancement in our society today.
To begin with, there are strong reasons why computers have become essential to both individuals and society. One major advantage is that the use of computers allows people to access and process information more efficiently, which can boost productivity. While potentially negative impacts are worth considering, I still reckon that the benefits of this invention are far more significant. For example, data from the OECD shows that applying digital tools in education and work can enhance people’s engagement by 35%. From my own experience, using computer-assisted platforms has significantly improved my academic performance.
Additionally, opponents of computer reliance highlight potential downsides. One common argument is that overusing computers may lead to screen addiction, which may result in mental health issues. Moreover, as far as society is concerned, the ultimate aim of government is to maintain and promote the well-being of society. For instance, a friend recently mentioned that he became overly dependent on online games, which eventually affected his academic results and social life. Thus, local governments and organizations should make a joint effort to ensure that the situation will develop in the right direction.
In conclusion, while there are strong arguments on both sides, I am convinced that computers stand out as the most impactful invention of our era.

In recent years, the topic of whether the number of new inventions has been evolving on a daily basis in our technological world has caused many debates and caught the public's attention. Some people think that computers have been proved beneficial or detrimental to society, and I agree with this viewpoint for both personal and social reasons.
First of all, I do believe the personal side is a strong reason for people to promote the development of a technological invention. While it is important to think about the possible negative effects of computing as a technological invention, I still believe that doing so can bring many benefits to society. For example, a famous American scientist once said that computing as a technological invention can make life more productive. As a matter of fact, based on my own experience, I think that computing as a technological invention can make me more responsible.
Moreover, social reasons can also be considered when looking at the significance of computing as a social invention. From the government's point of view, their main goal is to support and improve society's well-being. Therefore, computing as a social invention could play a key role in the overall success of the community. For example, recent research showed that more than half of people surveyed think that the government should pay more attention to computing as a social invention and provide better financial support.
In conclusion, I strongly believe that the benefits of computing as a social invention are greater than the downsides. To address this issue, both individuals and society should work together and pay more effort.

3.Television. 电视  

Television has many functions to play in everyone's life. For some, it's relaxation; for some, it is a companion. To what extent do you think the statement is true? Please provide your argument and supporting evidence from your own experience.

---
In recent years, the topic of whether television has many functions to play in everyone's life has sparked numerous debates and captured the attention of the public. Some people believe that television is good because it provides relaxation and companionship, and I agree with this viewpoint because of both individual and societal reasons. First and foremost, I believe the individual aspect is a compelling reason for governments to promote the widespread use of televisions. While it is important to consider the potential negative impacts of spending too much time watching television, I still hold the view that television can bring many benefits to society. For example, a well-known American scientist once mentioned that watching television can make our lives more efficient. From my own experience, I enjoy watching television because it can make me happy. In addition, societal factors should also be taken into account when evaluating the significance of television. From the perspective of governments, their ultimate goal is to maintain and promote the well-being of our society. Therefore, television should play an important role in the overall prosperity of our communities. For instance, recent research published in The Economist revealed that more than half of the respondents believe that the government should recognise the importance of television and provide more financial support. In conclusion, I firmly believe that the advantages of spending time on television outweigh the disadvantages. To tackle this issue, both individuals and society as a whole should join forces and make a concerted effort.

There is an ongoing debate in today 's world about whether television functions as a relaxation or a companion. Based on personal experiences and beliefs, many people express the idea that television plays an important role in everyone 's life. I strongly agree with this view. This essay will explore the various scenarios of the topic and demonstrate the viewpoint with a logical narrative. To begin with, a key reason for supporting television 's necessity is that it can be highly beneficial, not only for leisure time but also expanding our knowledge through news and documentaries.
For example, watching television often engages you in some affairs happening around the world or dramas that echo with you. People who live alone are found to be more likely to turn the television on while they are home. These benefits can boost individuals ' confidence and motivation, helping them thrive in different areas of life. Clearly, the advantages of taking part in such should not be overlooked. On the contrary, spending too much time on television is bad for our health and sight.
This means people would gain weight and become short - sighted by just sitting in front of the television at home. For example, a recent report by a leading research institution stated that 85 % of people who watch three hours ' television are more easily distracted than people who only watch for an hour. Therefore, it is understandable why many are against the idea of wasting on television.
I see that there is equally potential evidence to support the arguments I have provided, and hence, I logically conclude my statement in a conclusive manner.

4.The advance of technology. 技术进步  

The advance of technology affects daily life. Mention a recent tech and elaborate on the pros and cons and justify.

---
In contemporary society, the controversial topic of the advance of technology never fails to attract public attention. Some people believe that the advance of technology affects daily life, such as the internet has changed the ways people study today. While others are convinced of the opposite view. From my perspective, I tend to advocate the former opinion and this essay will explore this trend. To commence with, a key reason for technology changing the ways lies in its necessity. Although potentially negative impacts of studying on the internet must be taken into account, I still maintain that the advance of technology can bring many benefits to people’s daily lives. To be specific, it can improve people’s efficiency at studying . For example, a well-known American scientist once said that technological development could boost the local economy. Moving on to consider the opposite view, opponents claim that technological development may increase the financial burden. As far as governments are concerted , their ultimate goal is to promote and maintain the well-being of society. For instance, a recent research published in The Economist revealed that more than half of people think governments should value the importance of technology and provide more management support. In conclusion, I firmly believe that the advance of technology has more advantages than disadvantages. To maximize its benefits, governments should make a concerted effort to promote and support its development.

Over the past few years, the advance of technology has gradually attracted widespread public attention. When it comes to daily life, different people have different points of view. From my perspective, I firmly believe that the advantages of the advance of technology affects daily life are overwhelming disadvantages. In this essay, I will analyse the reasons for the advantages of the advance of technology and suggest potential solutions.
To begin with, one significant driving cause of individual aspects is the rapid increase of the advance of technology. It is essential to maintain a balance between lifestyle and social activity. To be more specific, statistics show that the majority of people prefer using a computer in their life to communicate with others and also more convenient in working rather than living without a computer. Consequently, it is reasonable to argue that the advantages of the advance of technology affects daily life are overwhelming disadvantages.
On the other hand, proponents of daily life contend that it is essential to consider societal factors. The advance of technology may seem a convenient option at first sight, but it can lead to undesirable outcomes, if we think about societal factors thoroughly. Moreover, recent studies indicate that there is a close relationship between mental health well-being and the quality of life. Therefore, the urgency of emphasising the advance of technology cannot be underestimated.
In summary, all these facts provide us with enough support for the idea that the advantages of the advance of technology affects daily life are overwhelming disadvantages.

5.Employees in decision-making. 员工参与决策  

Today, many employers involve their employees in the decision-making process of products and services. What are the advantages and disadvantages?

---
In recent years, the topic of whether many employers should involve thier employees in the decision-making process of products and services has sparked numerous debates and captured the attention of the public. Some people argue that employees should take part in the decision-making process of products and services and I agree with this viewpoint because of both individual and societal reasons.
First and foremost, I believe the individual aspect is a compelling reason for many companies to promote the efficiency of working. While it is important to consider the potential negative impacts of employees taking part in the decision-making process. I still hold the view that employees taking part in the decision-making process can bring many benefits to our society. For example, a well-known American scientist once said that employees taking part in the decision-making process can make our lives more efficient.
In addition, societal factors should also be taken into account when evaluating the significance of employees taking part in the decision-making process. From the perspective of governments, their ultimate goal is to maintain and promote the well-being of society. Therefore , employees taking part in the decision-making process should play an important role in the overall prosperity of our communities. For instance, recent research published in The Economist revealed that more than half of respondents think the government should recognize the importance of employees taking part in the decision-making process and provide more financial support.
In conclusion, I firmly believe that the advantages of employees taking part in the decision-making process outweigh the disadvantages. To tackle this issue, both individuals and society as a whole should join forces and make a concerted effort.

Nowadays, whether employees should be involved in the decision-making process of products and services has sparked a heated debate. After thorough consideration of all relevant factors, I believe that involving staff in the decision-making process has both advantages and disadvantages. This essay will explore key reasons to support this argument.
First and foremost, when viewed from the financial perspective, it is evident that high staff engagement will increase the financial burdens for the company. Although the potentially positive impacts of high staff engagement should also be taken into account, I still believe that encouraging employees to engage in the decision-making process has in many ways harmed us. For instance, a recent research study conducted by the University of Melbourne revealed that 60% of companies feel significant financial stress after giving employees more opportunities to engage in the decision-making process. Therefore, it clearly shows that enhancing staff engagement has some financial disadvantages.
However, despite its disadvantages, high staff engagement can also bring many advantages. As far as society is concerned, the ultimate goal of promoting staff engagement is to promote the company's efficiency. For example, a prominent scientist once stated that about 85% of companies believe that getting feedback and suggestions from employees can help them make correct decisions regarding products and services. Undoubtedly, this is a clear indication that employers should try to enhance staff engagement.
In conclusion, due to all the factors outlined above, I strongly agree that involving employees in the decision-making process of products and services has both advantages and disadvantages. To move things forward, all parties involved must make a concerted effort to communicate and start changing. With all our efforts, we can certainly make this world a much better place to live.

6.Large shopping malls. 大型购物中心  

In many towns and cities, large shopping malls are replacing small shops. What is your opinion about this? Discuss with appropriate examples.

---
Nowadays, large shopping malls are replacing small shops, and this topic has drawn significant public attention, prompting widespread discussions. While some people emphasize the benefits of large shopping malls, others are concerned about the potential problems they brings. From my perspective, I firmly believe that large malls are beneficial for our society and our lives.
Primarily, I believe that large malls are more convenient. Nevertheless, the potentially negative impacts of large malls must be taken into account. To be more specific, large malls offer a variety of different goods and services, which means that people can save their shopping time. To further support this statement, I recently read an article which found that 81% of people believe that large malls can increase their shopping efficiency, making it easier to compare prices and products quickly. Drawing from my personal experience, I am firmly convinced that large malls can increase economic development.
Additionally, another reason for my belief is that large malls can help us save money. As we all know, there are many discount campaigns in large malls, which means that people can purchase things at a lower price. According to a research study by the University of Oxford, more than 70% of participants said that they prefer to go to large malls as these offer a more enjoyable shopping experience with better facilities. This serves as a compelling example supporting the fact that large malls are beneficial to our lives.
In conclusion, I hold the view that large malls have some advantages because of shopping efficiency and economic development. It is crucial for us to address this issue, as doing so paves the way for a brighter future.

In recent years, the topic of whether large shopping malls are replacing small shops in many towns and cities has sparked numerous debates and captured the attention of the public. From my perspective, I believe that it is beneficial for customers to replace small shops with large shopping malls for both individual and societal reasons.
First and foremost, I believe the individual aspect is a compelling reason for governments to promote the development of large shopping malls. While it is important to consider the potential negative impacts of a monopoly, I still hold the view that large shopping malls can bring many benefits to our society. For example, a well-known American scientist once said that large shopping malls can make our lives more efficient. As a matter of fact, based on my own experience, I think that large shopping malls can provide higher quality products at more reasonable prices.
In addition, societal factors should also be taken into account when evaluating the significance of replacing small shops with large shopping malls. From the perspective of governments, their ultimate goal is to maintain and promote the well-being of society. Therefore, replacing small shops with large shopping malls should play an important role in the overall prosperity of our communities. For instance, recent research published in The Economist revealed that more than half of the respondents think the government should recognize the importance of replacing small shops with large shopping malls and provide more financial support.
In conclusion, I firmly believe that the advantages of replacing small shops with large shopping malls outweigh the disadvantages. To tackle this issue, both individuals and society as a whole should join forces and make a concerted effort.

7.Work. 工作  

Nowadays, it is increasingly more difficult to maintain the right balance between work and other aspects of one's life, such as leisure time with family members. How important do you think this balance is? Why do people find it hard to achieve?

---
Nowadays, the topic of balance between work and life has drawn significant public attention, prompting widespread discussions. While some people emphasize the benefits of a healthy work mode and a healthy lifestyle, others are concerned about the potential problems. From my perspective, I firmly believe that we should balance our work and life although it is difficult.
Primarily, I believe that not maintaining the right balance between work and life may cause mental issues. To be more specific, people will suffer from many mental disorders, and spending too little time with family will lead to a family relationship breakdown. To further support this statement, I recently read an article that found 81% of people believe that they are under pressure because of longer work hours. Drawing from my personal experience, I am firmly convinced that maintaining the right balance between work and life can increase our mental and physical health problems.
Additionally, another reason for my belief is that it is hard to maintain the right balance between work and life. As we all know, the cost of living is high, and we need to earn more money to support our family. We need to spend more time on work to get a higher salary, which can improve our living standards. According to a research study by the University of Oxford, more than 70% of participants think that the competitive work environment is also another reason. This serves as a compelling example supporting the fact that maintaining the right balance between work and life is difficult.
In conclusion, I hold the view that keeping a balance between work and life is very important because of mental health and physical health. It is crucial for us to address this issue, as doing so paves the way for a brighter future.

In recent years, the topic of the right balance between work and other aspects of one’s life has widespread debates and captured the attention of the public. Some people argue that it is increasingly more difficult to maintain the right balance between work and other aspects of one’s life, such as time with family and leisure needs, and I agree with this viewpoint for both individual and societal reasons. Moreover, I also think this balance is extremely important to us. Therefore, people find it hard to achieve that work is a very busy limited time to balance leisure needs.
First of all, I believe the individual aspect is a compelling reason for the government to promote balancing life. While it is very important to consider the potential negative impacts of family and leisure needs, I still hold this view that family and leisure needs can bring many benefits. For example, the study by Oxford University, which stated that 77% of the respondents voted that the right balance can substantially improve the experience of our work and daily life.
In addition, societal factors should also be taken into account when evaluating the significance of the right balance. From the perspective of governments, their ultimate goal is to maintain and promote the well-being of our society. Therefore, time with family should play an important role in the overall prosperity of our communities. According to the annual report of the Australian government, more than 78% of citizens stated that the government should recognize the significance of other aspects of one’s life and allocate great financial resources to support it.
In conclusion, I believe that the advantages of the right balance outweigh the disadvantages. To tackle this issue, both individuals and society as a whole should join forces and make a concerted effort.

8.Children's acts. 儿童行为  

Parents should be held legally responsible for their children's acts. What is your opinion? Support it with personal examples.

---
Nowadays, the topic of whether parents should be held legally responsible for the actions of their children has drawn significant public attention, prompting widespread discussions. While some people emphasize that parents should be responsible for their children, others disagree with the point of view. From my perspective, I firmly believe that parents should be responsible for their children.
Primarily, I believe that children are immature and irrational so they can't handle difficult problems. Nevertheless, the potentially negative impacts of parents' responsibilities must be taken into account. To be more specific, when children are too young, they can not distinguish between right and wrong, so parents should supervise their children's actions. To further support this statement, I recently read an article that found 81% of people believe that children know little about the laws, so they may engage in illegal activities. Drawing from my personal experience, I am firmly convinced that parents should be responsible for their children.
Additionally, another reason for my belief is that parents should guide their children's behaviors. As we all know, children may mimic their parents' behaviors, so it is important for parents to set a good example. According to a research study by the University of Oxford, more than 74% of the participants think that children's behaviors are influenced by their parents. This serves as a compelling example supporting the fact that parents should be responsible for their children.
In conclusion, I hold the view that parents should be responsible for their children because children are too young and immature. It is crucial for us to address this issue, as doing so paves the way for a brighter future.

---
In contemporary society, whether parents should be legally responsible for their children's actions is beneficial or harmful has attracted numerous controversies and drawn the public's attention. From my perspective, I believe that parents should absolutely be held legally responsible for the actions of their children and it will be a significant and positive development in our modern society.
First and foremost, there are many compelling reasons why parents should be held legally responsible. Also, the advantages are clear. For example, parents are directly related to their children and have the strongest influence on them. Although other potential negative impacts should be taken into account, I maintain that parents educate their children as guardians. As our parents have, in many ways, greatly influenced our actions and thinking. This is clearly demonstrated in recent research conducted by Harvard University which revealed that children tend to mimic their parents' actions unconsciously, further solidifying the view that parents are the most influential teachers in their children's lives. As a matter of fact, based on my own personal experience, parents and children always have similar personalities and behaviours in daily lives.
On the other hand, those who argue against my opinion present an alternative viewpoint. Primarily, they argue that children should be responsible for themselves as individuals when they are considered as adults. Additionally, they contend that children should take responsibility for their own actions and they should have the same human rights as others. Consequently, governments and international organisations should collaborate to promote positive developments that contribute to the enhancement and sustainability of public well-being.
In conclusion, we should not overlook the points discussed above. Although there are strong arguments on both sides, I firmly believe that parents should be held legally responsible for their children's actions.

9.Responsible for climate change. 对气候变化负责  

Climate change is a concerning global issue. Who should take the responsibility, governments, big companies, or individuals?

---
Nowadays, the topic of climate change has drawn significant public attention, prompting widespread discussions. While some people emphasize that governments should take responsibility, others argue that big companies or individuals should take responsibility. From my perspective, I firmly believe that governments should take responsibility for climate change.
Primarily, I believe that governments have strong power to change the climate. Nevertheless, the potentially negative impacts of climate change must be taken into account. To be more specific, governments can get access to the latest information and new technologies timely, which can control climate change. To further support this statement, I recently read an article that found 81% of people believe that governments can set a series of regulations and rules to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Drawing from my personal experience, I am firmly convinced that governments should take responsibility for climate change.
Additionally, another reason for my belief is that governments have sufficient funds to develop new technologies. As we all know, developing renewable energy is difficult and complex, requiring significant financial investment and government support. According to a research study by the University of Oxford, more than 70% of the participants think that governments can apply renewable energy in the public transportation system to reduce environmental pollution. This serves as a compelling example supporting that governments can take action against climate change.
In conclusion, I hold the view that governments should take responsibility for climate change because governments have the power and funds. It is crucial for us to control climate change, as doing so paves the way for a brighter future.

Over the past few years, climate change has gradually attracted widespread public attention. When it comes to a concerning global issue , different people have different points of view. From my perspective, I firmly believe that I agree governments, big companies and individuals should take the responsibility for climate change. In this essay, I will analyse the reasons for the resposibility and suggest potential solutions.
To begin with, one significant driving cause of the societal factors is the rapid increase of climate change. It is essential to maintain a balance between responsibility of the government and global issue . To be more specific, statistics show that the majority of people prefer governments to be leaders to solve the issues of climate change rather than individual work of climate change. Consequently, it is reasonable to argue that I agree governments, big companies and individuals should take the responsibility for climate change.
On the other hand, proponents of climate change contend that it is essential to consider the environmental impact. A concerning global issue may seem a convenient option at first sight, but it can lead to undesirable outcomes, if we think about the environmental impact thoroughly. Moreover, recent studies indicate that there is a close relationship between mental health well-being and the quality of life. Therefore, the urgency of emphasising climate change cannot be underestimated.
In summary, all these facts provide us with enough support for the idea that I agree governments, big companies and individuals should take the responsibility for climate change.

10.Marketing. 市场营销  

Should marketing in companies producing consumer goods like food and clothing, place emphasis on the reputation of the company or short-term strategies like discounts and special offers? Why?

---
Currently, the issue of whether marketing for consumer goods companies should focus on reputation or on short term sales has triggered a heated debate, An increasing number of people claim that ancient buildings can provide benefits to our society, Nevertheless, others hold different opinions. In this essay, I will elaborate on my point of view and thus lead to a constructive conclusion.
Initially, there are numerous reasons for the importance of good reputation, and the most obvious one lies in the fact that good faith can enhance the customer loyalty, As an illustration, a survey conducted by the University of Sydney revealed that most people believe that it is critical for companies to focus on their fame.
Moreover, there are some benefits, and the most significant one comes from the fact that focusing on reputation can improve their long-term revenue. The potential positive impacts cannot be ignored or taken lightly. Based on my experience, one of my friends is motivated to improve the quality of his products in his company, and as a result, more consumers are attracted to consume his products.
Considering all the substantial insights which are outlined above, one can safely reach the conclusion that the positive impacts of focusing on reputation outweigh the drawbacks. Therefore, I strongly recommend keeping this trend in the future for societies to take careful steps to mitigate potential problems.

Nowadays, the topic of whether companies should place emphasis on the reputation of the company or short-term strategies has drawn significant public attention, prompting widespread discussions. While some people emphasize the benefits of reputation, others are concerned about the potential problems of short-term strategies. From my perspective, I firmly believe that companies should focus on reputation.
Primarily, I believe that reputation can sustain long-term development. Nevertheless, the potentially negative impacts must be taken into account. To be more specific, reputation can reduce marketing expenditures, thereby helping companies make more profits. To further support this statement, I recently read an article which found that 81% of people believe that reputation can improve the competitiveness of products, which can help companies to increase their market share. Drawing from my personal experience, I am firmly convinced that companies should focus on reputation.
Additionally, another reason for my belief is that reputation can attract customers. As we all know, reputation can gain trust from potential customers, which can improve customer loyalty. According to a research study by the University of Oxford, more than 71% of participants think that consumers prefer to purchase from brands they recognize and trust, even if prices are higher. This serves as a compelling example supporting the fact that a good reputation helps businesses earn more money with less effort.
In conclusion, I hold the view that companies should focus on reputation for long-term development. It is crucial for companies to build a good reputation, as doing so paves the way for a prosperous future.

11.Law. 法律  

Some people believe the law changes human behavior while others think laws have little effect. What is your opinion?

---
At present, the law has caused numerous controversies and attracted much attention from the public . Some individuals believe that the law changes human behavior , while others hold the view that laws have little effect . As far as I am concerned , I am in favor of the former opinion .
First and foremost , there are plenty of solid reasons why I think that laws change human behavior should be our focus . Although potentially negative impacts of the law should be taken into account . I still reckon that guidance by law does good than harm . For example , a well - known American scientist once revealed that more than 80 % of people will choose to learn and abide by the law , making it the best choice for them .
On the contrary , it is believed by some other people that laws have little effect , because the regulations and rules in laws presented on paper can not change human behaviors . However , their argument fails to address the obvious problem of severing punishments playing a vital role in society all the time . For instance , more than 60 % of people prefer to protect themselves by law .
Considering all the substantial insights which are described above , one can safely reach the conclusion that the law changes human behavior , which reveals itself in many aspects as discussed .

---
Some people think human behaviors can be changed by laws, while others think laws have little effect. This controversial topic never fails to attract public attention. There has been a heated debate. Personally speaking, human behaviors can be changed by laws. In this essay, I will discuss my opinion on this idea, considering its advantages and disadvantages.
It is evidently reasonable for me to believe that this issue has the potential to profoundly impact and transform both our lives and society. This is because severe punishments by laws can prevent people from taking part in crime. To illustrate this, my personal experience is a convincing example. Citizens’ sense of right and wrong is shaped by laws, which influence their behaviors. People will assume their responsibilities based on the requirements of laws. People will assume their responsibilities based on the requirement of laws. Recently, numerous studies have also shown similar results, further supporting the notion.
When it comes to the outlook on this matter, there are numerous people who harbor completely divergent beliefs and opinions. In contrast, it is commonly believed that the regulations and rules in laws presented on paper cannot change human behaviors. Laws cannot change people’s behavior as the crime rate is still high in recent years. The legal system is not comprehensive enough and cannot give people clear instructions for their actions. People can exploit some loophole in the law to be involved in some illegal activities. However, this argument is weak and lacks solid evidence to support its validity.
In a nutshell, due to the mentioned reasons, we may safely reach the conclusion. The above discourse, viewpoints and examples presented serve as a conclusive validation of the argument at hand.

12.Getting married. 结婚  

It is argued that getting married before finishing your studies or getting established in a good job is foolish. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

---
Nowadays, whether getting married before completing education or securing employment is a thorny problem that confuses many people. Different people have different opinions. From my perspective, I firmly believe that getting married before establishing one's career is indeed unwise. I will share some of my ideas.
On the one hand, early marriage often leads to financial instability. Thus, it is clearly shown that marrying without a stable income is problematic. This can be established by a study by Oxford University, which stated that 76% of young couples who married before securing jobs reported substantial financial difficulties in their daily lives.
On the other hand, early marriage also has some drawbacks. First, it may lead to interrupted education, as seen in many students who dropped out after getting married. Second, as far as professional development is concerned, not everyone has the necessary maturity to handle both marital responsibilities and career building. Therefore, young adults should wait until they are financially and emotionally ready for marriage.
In conclusion, while there are some arguments in favor of early marriage, I still firmly believe that getting married before finishing school or getting a job is foolish, because numerous case studies show that couples who wait until after establishing their careers report higher marital satisfaction and financial stability.

---
Nowadays, it is argued that getting married before finishing school or getting a job is foolish. This question has attracted numerous controversies and drawn the public's attention. There has been a heated debate on it. From my perspective, I believe that getting married too early is not a wise decision. There are an array of pros and cons due to mental and emotional reasons.
Firstly, it has been argued that the mental reason is that young people are not ready to deal with the pressure of marriage. Although potentially positive impacts of early marriage must be taken into account, I still believe that marriage before education or a job can create stress. For example, a famous American scientist has said that a good career helps build a good family. Therefore, it is beyond the shadow of a doubt that finishing school or getting a job first is better.
However, on no account can we turn a blind eye to the emotional reason that some people fall in love and want to stay together. As far as our society is concerned, the aim of marriage is to create a stable life. For instance, recent research conducted by Harvard University has revealed that young couples without income often face many problems. Therefore, it is undoubted that early marriage can bring many risks.
To sum up, I hold the view that marriage should come after school and work because of the mental and emotional reasons outlined above. To address this issue, the government and society should work together to raise awareness.

13.Governments' problems. 政府面临的问题  

The world's governments and organizations are facing a lot of issues. Which do you think is the most pressing problem for the inhabitants of our planet and give the solution?

---
There is no doubt that climate change plays an important role in today's world, and the statement that the world's governments and organizations are facing a lot of issues has sparked public attention. Personally, I firmly believe that the most pressing problem for the inhabitants of our planet is climate change, which can be supported by the reasons as follows.
To begin with, it is obvious that climate change offers a range of disadvantages, which are evident in various fields, such as weather, nature and daily life. One common view is that it can result in sea-level rising. Besides, climate change has, in many ways, significantly harmed our lives. For instance, a well-known American scientist once said the most precious gift for us is nature.
Furthermore, climate change may also leads to some serious concerns. For instance, improper use of farming has resulted in some issues. Some studies suggest that climate change can cause long-term difficulties for our earth. Therefore, it is evident that the drawbacks of climate change need to be effectively managed to minimize the negative impacts.
In light of the above discussion, it is reasonable to conclude that the biggest problem for the inhabitants of our planet is climate change. In this regard, we should use fewer plastic bags and take public transport to reduce pollution. And it is crucial for governments, organizations and individuals to work together to address this situation.

---
In recent years, the issue of the world's governments and organisations facing a lot of issues has sparked numerous controversies and drawn widespread public attention. Some people believe that the issue is climate change, while others argue it is unnecessary. From my point of view, I firmly support the notion that the world's governments and organisations are facing big issues like climate change.
First and foremost, there are several compelling reasons why this viewpoint is valid. The most prominent one is that climate change will have a detrimental effect on the ecological environment. Although rising sea levels should be taken into account, I still believe that environmental laws, in many ways, can enormously transform the lifestyle of the majority. For instance, a renowned expert once remarked that governments can make policies and laws to restrict people's or companies' behaviour.
Additionally, another important reason to consider is that the sea level has risen. From a societal perspective, the ultimate goal of utilising renewable resources is to enhance living standards, making life more efficient and interconnected. Policies can help us achieve higher overall satisfaction and happiness for our mental well-being, fostering a sense of responsibility.
In conclusion, after carefully analysing all aspects of this issue, I still firmly believe that the world's governments and organisations are facing big issues like climate change. Achieving this requires collective efforts from the government to establish a comprehensive social support system that addresses the challenges and ensures exclusivity and security.

14.No need for newspapers. 不再需要报纸  

There is no need for newspapers in the modern world. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

---
In recent years, there has been a heated debate on whether it is needed for newspapers in the modern world. This essay will discuss both sides of the arguments regarding newspapers.
From my perspective, I suppose that newspapers have both positive and negative effects on individuals and society. So, I agree that we need newspapers in the modern world. First and foremost, it is widely acknowledged that convenience is why I believe that we need newspapers. To be more specific, nobody can deny the simple fact that newspapers make it easier for old people to get the latest information. Needless to say, newspapers not only benefit old people, when it comes to being effective, but they can also enhance productivity and the quality of our lives, with much ease, efficacy, and convenience. For example, it is convenient for old people if they don't know how to use new technology devices. As a result, there is no doubt that newspapers are needed for the modern world.
However, another pivotal factor should be considered is environmental problems. In other words, newspapers are not necessary for modern society, because they might result in air pollution and global warming. Moreover, smart phones are a good case in point that makes it easier for people to get information on the internet. Thus, it is quite reasonable to believe that it is not necessary for newspapers in the modern world.
In a nutshell , due to the aforementioned reasons, I strongly hold the opinion that we need newspapers in the modern world.

---
Nowadays, many headlines hit the newspaper on the topic of newspapers in the modern world. This sparked a huge debate on whether there is no need for newspapers in the modern world. From my perspective, I believe that it is necessary for newspapers to exist in the modern world.
On the one hand, there are numerous solid reasons why it is necessary for newspapers to exist in the modern world. For example, reading newspapers can broaden our horizons. Although potentially negative impacts of this need should be taken into account, which means newspapers may waste our time and energy, I still reckon that newspapers have, in many ways, enormously enriched our lives. For instance, a well-known American socialist once said that newspapers are our official method of verifying our current facts. Moreover, reading newspapers can allow us to gain more knowledge and increase our work chances in the future.
On the other hand, those who argue against newspapers hold a different opinion. In the first place, it can be claimed that newspapers are now out of date because newspapers may increase our burden. In the second place, as far as schools are concerned, the ultimate aim of schools is to shape young people into responsible citizens. As a result, local governments and international organizations should make a joint effort to make sure that this situation will progress in the right direction.
In conclusion, while there are strong arguments on both sides, I still firmly believe that it is necessary for newspapers to exist in the modern world.

15.Travel overseas for study. 出国留学  

There is no value in traveling overseas to study, as you can be a good scholar even without leaving your home base. Is it necessary to travel overseas for a better education?

---
Currently, the issue of whether there is no value in traveling overseas for studying has triggered a heated debate. An increasing number of people claim that a good scholar and traveling for a better education can provide benefits to our society. Nevertheless, others hold different opinions. In this essay, I will elaborate on my point of view and thus lead to a constructive conclusion.
Initially, there are numerous reasons for the importance of good scholar and traveling for a better education, and the most obvious one lies in the fact that it helps us bring a positive influence on people. As an illustration, a survey conducted by the University of Sydney revealed that most people believe that it is critical for us to help people to have a broader view of life.
Moreover, there are some benefits, and the most significant one comes from the fact that it will maintain and promote the well-being of society. The potential positive impact should not be ignored or taken lightly. For example, a well-known American scientist once said that it can make people enjoy higher levels of emotional and physical well-being.
Considering all the important points above, one can safely reach a conclusion that the positive impacts of a good scholar and traveling for a better education outweigh the drawbacks. Therefore, I strongly recommend keeping this trend in the future for societies and making sure that this situation will develop in the right direction.

Over the past few years, travelling overseas to study has gradually attracted widespread public attention. When it comes to no value, different people have different points of view. From my perspective, I firmly believe that I agree it is necessary to travel overseas for a better education. In this essay, I will analyse the reasons for why travel overseas for a better education and suggest potential solutions.
To begin with, one significant driving cause of individual aspects is the rapid increase of travelling overseas to study. It is essential to maintain a balance between individual challenges and mental health well-being. To be more specific, statistics show that the majority of people prefer challenging themselves to learning more knowledge and knowing the differences of the world when studying overseas rather than without leaving their home base and learning a single culture in a same place. Consequently, it is reasonable to argue that I agree it is necessary to travel overseas for a better education.
On the other hand, proponents of travelling overseas contend that it is essential to consider societal factors. A better education may seem a convenient option at first sight. However, it may lead to undesirable outcomes, if we think about societal factors thoroughly. Moreover, recent studies indicate that there is a close relationship between economic growth and cross culture communication. Therefore, the urgency of emphasising travelling oversea to study cannot be underestimated.
In summary, all these facts provide us with enough support for the idea that I agree it is necessary to travel overseas for a better education.

16.Extreme sports. 极限运动  

Nowadays, more and more people engage in dangerous activities, such as skydiving and motorcycling. Are you in favor of them? Why? Use examples to support your opinion.

---
Nowadays, the topic of extreme or adventure sports has drawn significant public attention, prompting widespread discussions. While some people emphasize that adventure sports can increase physical health, others are concerned about the potential problems of adventure sports. From my perspective, I firmly believe that extreme or adventure sports have both advantages and disadvantages.
Primarily, I believe that adventure sports can enhance people's physical strength. Nevertheless, the potentially negative impacts of adventure sports must be taken into account. To be more specific, people want to pursue adventure and excitement, which can enlarge their social circles. To further support this statement, I recently read an article which found that 81% of people believe that taking part in adventure sports can experience new things, and people gain a sense of self-satisfaction. Drawing from my personal experience, I am firmly convinced that adventure sports are beneficial to our physical and mental health.
Additionally, another reason for my belief is that adventure sports also have some drawbacks. As we all know, many people may get seriously injured when they engage in adventure activities. According to a research study by the University of Oxford, more than 70% of the participants think that adventure sports require a large amount of money, which may cause a financial burden. This serves as a compelling example supporting that adventure sports are very dangerous and time-consuming.
In conclusion, I hold the view that adventure sports have both advantages and disadvantages because people can get a new experience. It is crucial for us to protect ourselves while participating in adventure sports.

---
In recent years, more people have shown interest in risky activities such as skydiving, motorcycling, bungee jumping, or extreme mountain climbing. While some view these pursuits as reckless, I believe that engaging in such activites can be beneficial - both for personal growth and for society - when done responsibly.
First of all, dangerous activities often provide individuals with a deep sense of accomplishment and confidence. For example, skydiving pushes people beyond their fears and offers an adrenaline rush that many find addictive. This sense of overcoming mental barriers can boost one's self-esteem. Similarly, although motorcycling is risky, can be a passionate hobby that fosters discipline and focus. Riders who take proper safety training and wear protective gear minimise their chances of injury.
What is more, these activities contribute largely to the economy and tourism industry. Countries like New Zealand and Switzerland promote adventure sports as part of their tourism campaigns, attracting thousands of thrill-seekers annually. These industries create jobs, support local businesses, and bring cultural exchange through travel.
However, it is important to note that risk must be managed. Just as people wear seatbelts while driving, those engaging in extreme sports must take necessary precautions, such as using certified equipment and following expert guidance.
In conclusion, I support dangerous activities as long as they are approached with caution and responsibility. They offer psychological, physical, and even economic benefits, making them more than just a thrill - they can be life-enhancing experiences.

17.Greatest inventions. 最伟大的发明  

In the past 100 years, there have been many inventions, such as antibiotics, airplanes, and computers. What do you think is the most important of them? Why?

---
Opinions on the issue of inventions vary widely. Although some individuals hold the view that inventions of biology, such as antibiotics, are the most important, others hold the view that inventions of engineering, such as airplanes and computers, have totally changed the way we live. From my perspective, I firmly believe computers are the most vital and indispensable inventions.
There are many reasons supporting my point of view. The primary reason why I think computers are the most valuable is that computers make communication much easier. Moreover, computers can help us process business data and scientific data, which stimulates economic growth and brings more job opportunities. Furthermore, computers can connect communities around the world and foster our understanding of their cultural backgrounds, which promotes the sharing of information. Although the negative impacts brought by computers, such as the need for a large amount of energy and potential negative impacts on global warming, should be taken into account, I still believe the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. It is beneficial because computers can boost the development of other technologies, such as artificial intelligence and biotechnologies, which can increase our living standards. According to many surveys, computers are facilitating most scientific research nowadays.
In conclusion, computers play a vital role in our daily lives. Considering what has been discussed, we need joint efforts from schools, policymakers and social groups.

---
In the recent past-paced world, the topic of whether there have been many inventions in the past 100 years has sparked numerous debates and captured the attention of the public. Personally speaking, I fully think that the computer is the most important invention in the past 100 years.
First and foremost, the individual aspect is widely recognized as the cornerstone of my viewpoint. While it is important to consider the potential negative impacts of the computer, I still hold the view that computers can bring many benefits to our society. To be more specific, the laptop improves employees' working efficiency through its multi-tasking features. For instance, a well-known American scientist once said that a computer can complete a complex work by itself instead of four or five people.
In addition, social factors should also be taken into account when evaluating the significance of a laptop. From the perspective of governments, their ultimate gold is to promote and maintain the well-being of inventions. To further support my statement, an article published in China Daily revealed that a computer could only complete the market statistics in ten days by writing and calculating on paper 100 years ago. So, the government should provide more financial support.
In conclusion, I do believe the advantages of the most important invention in the past 100 years outweigh the disadvantages. To tackle this issue, both individuals and society should make a joint effort to ensure the situation will develop in the right direction.

18.Formal writing examination. 正式写作考试  

Whether formal written examinations can be a valid method to assess the learning of students. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

---
In recent years, whether the formal written examination can be a valid method to assess students' learning has attracted numerous controversies and drawn the public's attention. Some people believe students cannot get good scores if they do not study, while others believe that it is not necessary. My view is that, I support the notion that the advantages of this method outweigh the disadvantages.
First and foremost, there are numerous solid reasons why it is valid to assess students' learning by their formal written examination, and the most obvious one is that the grade of written examination is useful to analyze students' learning. Although the potentially negative impacts of methods also should be taken into account, which means that students may not try their best in our examination, and they may feel anxious, I still reckon that methods could have, in many ways, enormously enriched people's lives. For example, a famous American scientist once said that the score of our exam is the results of students' learning, which is vital to evaluate their levels.
Moreover, another reason that should be considered is that although the score of the exam may be wrong, it is beneficial. As far as society is concerned, the ultimate aim of methods is to make everyone enjoy their daily lives. Thus, it is a clear indication that they are vital to the development of technology, because students can learn from them.
I know that there is equally potential evidence to support the arguments I have provided, and hence, I logically conclude my statement in a conclusive manner.

---
In modern society, discussion focused on written examinations is consistently attracting public attention. This issue has sparked a huge debate on whether formal written examinations can be a valid method to assess students' learning. From my perspective, the idea that the formal written examination can not be a valid method to assess students' learning is a vital component of this discussion.
First and foremost, there are a multitude of reasons why the formal written examination can not be a valid method to assess students' learning, and the most prominent one is that the ability of students' learning should be analysed from different aspects, such as critical thinking skills and presentations. Although the potentially negative impact should also be taken into account, which means the formal written examination can directly show if the students' scale of knowledge is expanded. I still firmly argue that dissertations and other assessing methods could have significantly enriched people's lives in many circumstances. A recent study in the related field revealed that if students are assessed from different circumstances, they are more likely to be successful in the future.
Moreover, another reason that I support is that this method can relieve students' mental and physical pressure. As far as schools are concerned, the ultimate goal of the written examination is to promote a sense of well-being and happiness for all students. As a result, it is a clear indication that all aspects of students' learning should be considered into their final grades.
In conclusion, after analysing all aspects of this discussion, I firmly argue that the formal written examination can not be a valid method to assess students' learning.

19.The information revolution. 信息革命  

The information revolution brought about by modern mass communication has positive and negative consequences for both individuals and society. Do you agree or disagree? Discuss and give examples and your own experience.

---
In modern society, the information revolution by modern mass communication has caused numerous controversies and drawn the attention of the public. While some people insist that it may increase internet addictions, others argue that it may improve the relationship with friends. Personally speaking, I think the information revolution can benefit everyone's life, so the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.
There are several reasons supporting my viewpoint. First and foremost, it is claimed that getting knowledge easily is beneficial, which makes sense because it helps with learning. To support this, I will use my own experience as an example. For instance, during my daily routine, I have noticed that online resources may improve the quality of life of individuals and communities.
Furthermore, social reasons are another factor that should be considered, as it is also argued that Internet addictions are a concern, which is reasonable because it leads to fake information. However, many people online have pointed out that fake information has become more serious in recent years. One of the main responsibilities of any government is to ensure public well-being, so it must take action to address issues like online security.
In conclusion, this topic is not only relevant today but will likely continue to impact society in the future. I firmly believe that the information revolution has more advantages than disadvantages. To address this issue, individuals and society should make a joint effort.

---
Obviously, there is no doubt that the information revolution plays a vital role in our daily lives. And the statement that it brings both positive and negative consequences has attracted attention from the public. As far as I am concerned, I believe that the information revolution has both advantages and disadvantages.
First of all, there are plenty of reasons why I believe that it is helpful. Nobody can deny the fact that mass communication helps people get news quickly. The latest research shows that most people get information from their phones or computers. As a matter of fact, based on my own experience, I read news on my phone every morning.
It should also be emphasized that there are some bad effects. Some people become addicted to the internet. This is probably due to the fact that they use social media too much. An increasing number of people hold the view that too much online time harms relationships. However, I strongly believe that we can reduce the negative effects if we use technology wisely. One of my friends told me he now sets time limits to avoid distractions.
In conclusion, we should never neglect what we have discussed above. Nowadays, more and more people are paying attention to the impact of mass communication. I do hope that this essay can provide them with some insights.

20.The mass media. 大众媒体  

Mass media, including TV and newspapers, has a great influence on humans, particularly on the younger generation. It has a pivotal role in shaping people's opinions. Discuss the extent you agree or disagree. Use your own experience or examples.

---
Opinions on the issue of mass media vary widely. Although some individuals hold the view that it has little impact on our daily lives, others argue that it can shape citizens' opinions due to its great influence. From my perspective, I firmly believe that mass media can shift our views.
There are many reasons supporting my point of view. The primary reason why I think TV and newspapers can change younger generations' view point is that they have a variety of information resources. Moreover, mass media has built strong connections with communities, which can influence people around us. Furthermore, due to the development of technologies, such as mobile phones and social media, the influence of mass media is becoming more and more powerful, which could continuously send information to its subscribers. Although the negative impacts brought by mass media, such as the possibility of biased coverage and misleading the public, should be taken into account, I still believe the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. It is beneficial because mass media can provide people with essential information, which can help people make daily decisions. According to my observations, most people buy or sell real estate properties based on the information they receive on TV or websites.
In conclusion, mass media plays a vital role in our daily lives. Considering what has been discussed, we need joint efforts from schools, policymakers and social groups.

---
Over the past few years, mass media has gradually attracted widespread public attention. When it comes to the younger generation, different people have different points of view. From my perspective, I firmly believe that I agree mass media has a great influence on humans. In this essay, I will analyse the reasons for shaping people's opinions and suggest potential solutions.
To begin with, one significant driving cause of individual aspects is the rapid increase of mass media. It is essential to maintain a balance between the mass media and the younger generation. To be more specific, statistics show that the majority of people prefer receiving information or learning from mass media to share ideas with each other rather than only listening to others' opinions. Consequently, it is reasonable to argue that I agree mass media has a great influence on humans.
On the other hand, proponents of shaping people's opinions contend that it is essential to consider societal factors. Influencing the younger generation may seem a convenient option at first sight. However, it may lead to undesirable outcomes, if we think about societal factors thoroughly. Moreover, recent studies indicate that there is a close relationship between mental health well-being and social life. Therefore, the urgency of emphasising mass media cannot be underestimated.
In summary, all these facts provide us with enough support for the idea that I agree mass media has a great influence on humans.

21.Formal Written Assessment. 正式书面评估  

Please discuss the significance of formal written assessments in today's world to evaluate children's performance. Do you agree that an education system that assesses the student's learning by written exam is correct?

---
There is no doubt that formal written assessments play a vital role in our society. This topic of whether it is significant for formal written assessments in today's world to evaluate children's performance has been widely debated . As far as I am concerned, I strongly agree that an education system that assesses the student's learning by written exam is correct, which can be supported by the reasons as follows.
First and foremost, it is obvious that formal written assessments are fair . In addition, it is efficient to access the student's learning . It is good for our lives in today's world where technology and education are advanced. It offers a range of advantages, which are evident in various domains, such as work and society. It is supported by a 2024 study from the University of Sydney, which found that 80% of the respondents believed that formal written assessments could significantly improve their work performance and daily lives.
However, despite its advantages, formal written assessments may also have disadvantages. To be more specific, it may increase mental pressure. Based on my own experience, formal written assessments are difficult. Some students cannot pass it. For instance, according to a U.S. government annual report, nearly 70% of citizens reported a strong correlation between formal written assessments and mental pressure. As a result, both teams and individuals should collaborate to ensure this trend develops in a positive direction.
In light of the above discussion, while there are many strong arguments on both sides, I firmly believe that an education system that assesses the student's learning by written exam is correct.

---
In the context of modern society, the discourse surrounding the method of assessing students’ learning has arisen to prominence, garnered significant attention from various segments of society. One prevailing view is that the formal written examination can be a valid method to assess students’ learning. Despite its contentious nature, I am inclined to agree with this viewpoint.
To begin with, one primary reason for supporting this perspective is that the formal written examination can quantify how much knowledge students have gained. This is empirically proven by WHO educational data, which found that 92% of students who got a good formal written examination grade ended up with a high-paying job as they have enough knowledge to support their work skills. Another major contributing factor to this standpoint is that the formal written examination can be a valid way to assess students’ learning because it is fair for every student. According to government white papers published by the Office for National Statistics in the UK, 78% of natives suggested that the formal written examination could significantly impact personal image and school environment in a positive manner.
However, it is understandable for some people to believe that the formal written examination is not a valid method to assess students’ learning. They may assume that it can only access certain parts of the learning materials so that it cannot assess their practical skills. Furthermore, the formal written test cannot apply knowledge in a real situation. Because it can only assess a student’s memory rather than abilities.
Taking all the points above into consideration, I honestly concur that the formal written examination can be a valid method to assess students’ learning.

22.Tourism. 旅游业  

In a less developed country, do you think the disadvantages of tourism can be as great as the advantages?

---
The debate over whether the disadvantages of tourism are equally massive as the advantages for less developed countries or not has gained considerable traction recently. As much as many argue that it is absolutely true, I believe that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. This essay will dive into multiple dimensions of the subject, and discuss the viewpoints with a structured approach.
One prominent opinion about the topic is that the pros and cons of tourism are similarly great for a less developed country. This is because even though tourism is profitable, a number of tourists from foreign countries definitely bring in issues due to the nature of different cultures, which can pose a threat and put countries that are not well developed at risk. An illustrative example is that numerous tourists might buy a lot of essential products at cheaper prices, leading to product shortages for local residents living in less developed countries. In summary, the stance taken validates the viewpoint discussed.
However, another viewpoint that I agree with is that the advantages of tourism outweigh the disadvantages for developing countries. This is owing to the fact that the government is capable of controlling most of the bad influences from tourists by actively monitoring and reasonable intervention. Furthermore, there is a relevant study indicating that the upsides of tourism absolutely outperform the downsides for most of the developing countries, especially in a financial way, which substantiates the viewpoint outlined.
In conclusion, though many individuals argue that the disadvantages of tourism are as big as the advantages, I truly reckon that the upsides of tourism outweigh the downsides for the majority of developing countries.

---
Nowadays, the topic of tourism in less developed countries has drawn significant public attention, prompting widespread discussions. While some people emphasize the benefits of the economy, others are concerned about the potential problems of the environment. From my perspective, I firmly believe that tourism in less developed countries has both advantages and disadvantages.
Primarily, I believe that tourism in less developed countries can stimulate economic growth. Nevertheless, the potentially negative impacts of tourism must be taken into account. To be more specific, tourism can promote cultural exchange, which may increase consumption. To further support this statement, I recently read an article which found that 81% of people believe that tourism can provide more job opportunities, and local companies make more profits, which can increase the employment rate. Drawing from my personal experience, I am firmly convinced that tourism can boost economic development.
Additionally, another reason for my belief is that tourism can cause environmental issues. As we all know, environmental pollution is serious nowadays, which may cause many physical health problems. According to a research study by the University of Oxford, more than 70% of the participants think that tourism leads to more greenhouse gas emissions, and it can increase carbon footprint, and traffic conditions may become worse. This serves as a compelling example supporting that tourism also brings certain disadvantages to the environment.
In conclusion, I hold the view that tourism in less developed countries has both advantages and disadvantages to the economy and the environment. It is crucial for us to protect the environment while developing tourism.

23.Deduct marks. 扣分  

Some universities deduct marks from students work if given late. What are your views and what action will you recommend taking?

---
Opinions on the issue of deducting marks vary widely. Although some individuals hold the view that deducting marks is not necessary, others argue that universities should deduct marks if given late. From my perspective, I firmly believe that the deduction of marks can help students learn better.
There are many reasons supporting my point of view. The primary reason why I think it is practical is that it motivates students to finish their assignments as early as possible. Moreover, deducting marks can also foster a sense of punctuality, which is very important to the development of students and can bring them a large number of career opportunities. Furthermore, it gives positive feedback to students who submit assignments on time, which can bring them positive feelings and enhance their level of happiness. Although the negative impacts brought by deducting marks, such as the possibility of losing the interests of studying, should be taken into account, I still believe the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. It is beneficial because students can learn how to finish their work before the deadline. According to my experience, students should finish their homework first rather than play games or have fun with their friends.
In conclusion, deducting marks plays a vital role in our daily lives. Considering what has been discussed, we need joint efforts from schools, policymakers and social groups.

---
Nowadays, the discussion about whether universities should deduct marks for late work has sparked widespread debate. Some people argue that reducing grades for overdue assignments is fair, and I totally agree with this statement for both individual and societal reasons.
Firstly, I do believe the individual aspect is the widely recognised reason for deducting marks from late work. For example, it teaches students to manage their time better. While the potential negative impact of stress should be considered, as it can affect some students' health, I still reckon that this policy has benefits for student development. For example, a well-known study stated that students who meet deadlines get 15% better jobs after graduation. Moreover, it prepares them for real workplace rules.
In addition, societal factors should also be considered when evaluating mark deduction for late work. From the perspective of universities, their primary objective is to ensure fair treatment. Since enforcing deadlines creates equal standards, which leads to better education quality. Ultimately, this can thereby contribute to a more responsible workforce. For instance, a recent survey showed that 60% of employers prefer graduates from strict universities.
In conclusion, while some students may struggle, I firmly maintain that deducting marks for late work does more good than harm. To help students, universities could offer better time management support.

24.Experiential learning. 体验式学习  

Some people point out that experiential learning( i. e., learning by doing) can work well in formal education. However, others think a traditional form of teaching is the best. Do you think experiential learning is beneficial in high school or college?

---
Currently, the issue of whether experiential learning can work well in high school or colleges has triggered a heated debate, An increasing number of people claim that experiential learning can provide benefits to our society, Nevertheless, others hold different opinions. In this essay, I will elaborate on my point of view and thus lead to a constructive conclusion.
Initially, there are numerous reasons for the importance of learning by doing it, and the most obvious one lies in the fact that practical experience can enhance students' problem-solving skills, As an illustration, a survey conducted by the University of Sydney revealed that most people believe that it is critical for us to combine learning with our daily life experience and thus foster our comprehensive ability.
Moreover, there are some benefits, and the most significant one comes from the fact that experiential learning can improve our critical thinking ability . The potential positive impacts cannot be ignored or taken lightly. According to the report published by Melbourne University, since experiential learning courses have been compulsory, the grades of undergraduates' critical thinking courses have been increase by 20% .
Considering all the substantial insights which are outlined above, one can safely reach the conclusion that the positive impacts of experiential learning outweigh the drawbacks. Therefore, I strongly recommend keeping this trend in the future for societies to take careful steps to mitigate potential problems.

---
In recent years, the topic of whether experiential learning can work well in formal education has caused many debates and caught the public's attention. Some people think that a traditional form of teaching is the best, and I agree with this viewpoint for both personal and social reasons. In addition, I think experiential learning is beneficial in high school.
First of all, I do believe the personal side is a strong reason for students to promote the development of experiential learning. While it is important to think about the possible negative effects of experiential learning in high school, I still believe that doing so can bring many benefits to society. For example, a famous American scientist once said that experiential learning in high school can make life more productive. As a matter of fact, based on my own experience, I think that experiential learning in high school can make me more responsible.
Moreover, social reasons can also be considered when looking at the significance of formal education in high school. From the government's point of view, their main goal is to support and improve society's well-being. Therefore, formal education in high school could play a key role in the overall success of the community. For example, recent research showed that more than half of people surveyed think that the government should pay more attention to formal education in high school and provide better financial support.
In conclusion, I strongly believe that the benefits of experiential learning in high school are greater than the downsides. To address this issue, both individuals and society should work together and pay more effort.

25.Personal life. 个人生活  

The time people devote to jobs leaves very little time for their personal lives. How widespread is the problem? What problem will this shortage of time cause?

---
Nowadays, people devote more time to jobs and leave very little time for personal life. The topic has drawn significant public attention, prompting widespread discussions. While some people emphasize that it is a widespread phenomenon, others are concerned about the potential problems it brings. From my perspective, I firmly believe that leaving very little time for personal life has certain disadvantages.
Primarily, I believe that leaving very little time for personal life may cause mental issues. To be more specific, people will suffer from many mental disorders, and a shortage of time will lead to a family relationship breakdown. To further support this statement, I recently read an article that found 81% of people believe that they are under pressure because of longer work hours. Drawing from my personal experience, I am firmly convinced that a shortage of time can increase our mental and physical health problems.
Additionally, another reason for my belief is that it is a widespread phenomenon because of a financial burden. As we all know, the cost of living is high, and we need to earn more money to support our family. We need to spend more time on work to get a higher salary, which can improve our living standards. According to a research study by the University of Oxford, more than 70% of the participants think that the competitive work environment is also another reason. This serves as a compelling example supporting the fact that shortage of time is a very widespread problem.
In conclusion, I hold the view that maintaining a balance between work and life is very important because of mental health and physical health. It is crucial for us to address this issue, as doing so paves the way for a brighter future.

Opinions on the issue of personal life vary widely. Although some individuals hold the view that people should focus on their jobs, others argue that this is problematic because this shortage of time can cause severe mental health problems. From my perspective, I firmly believe people should have abundant personal time.
There are many reasons supporting my point of view. The primary reason why I think personal time is essential is that we can have quality time with friends and family, which can offer us greater emotional well-being. Moreover, only with enough personal time can we manage to hone our professional skills, which can significantly enhance our productivity. Furthermore, leaving abundant time for our personal lives can reduce the level of anxiety and stress. According to many surveys, most office workers have high levels of psychological problems. Although the negative impacts brought by personal life, such as the possibility of becoming lazy, should also be taken into account, I still believe the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. It is beneficial because we can spend more time shopping, which can stimulate economic growth and attract more investments.
In conclusion, personal life plays a vital role in our daily lives. Considering what has been discussed, we need joint efforts from schools, policy makers and social groups.

26.Studying films. 电影研究  

Whether studying films at school is as important as studying literature? Do you think schools should have a curriculum asking students to play old drama and work for theater centuries ago?

---
Nowadays, many headlines hit the newspaper on the topic of studying films. This issue has sparked a huge debate on whether schools should have a curriculum asking students to play old drama and work for theater centuries ago. From my perspective, I believe that studying films is as important as studying literature.
On the one hand, there are numerous solid reasons why studying films is as important as studying literature. For example, studying films can broaden students’ horizons and expand their scope of knowledge. Although the potentially negative impacts of studying films, like wasting time, should be taken into account. I still firmly reckon that studying films has, in many ways, enriched people’s lives. For instance, an American socialist once said that studying films could make the whole society more livable. Moreover, students can access historical knowledge through playing old dramas and working for theater centuries ago.
On the other hand, those who argue against studying films hold a different opinion. In the first place, it can be claimed that studying films distracts people from their studies. In the second place, as far as schools are concerned. The ultimate aim of schools is to shape young people into excellent people in the future. As a result, local governments and schools should make a joint effort to make sure that this situation will develop in the right direction.
In conclusion, while there are many strong arguments on both sides, I still firmly believe that studying films is as important as studying literature.

In contemporary society, there's an on-going debate on whether learning old drams and works from centuries ago for high school students should be viewed as a positive or negative impact on people. While it is possible to claim that studying classical literature may have some drawback, I believe that it has in many ways enormously enriched people's lives. In this essay, I shall explain my point of view by analyzing both sides of the argument.
To start with, it is undeniable that studying classical literature may have some downsides. Firstly, it is claimed that it may increase students' burden in high school. Moreover, there are also concerned about the fact that it might distract high-school students from learning other subjects and affect the academic performance.
However, those who are argue for the positive impacts of learning works of theaters from several centuries ago have a different view. Firstly, the most obvious argument lies in the fact that it could be beneficial to gain more knowledge about classical literature. Furthermore, it should be taken into account that it could help high-school students to widen their range of knowledge. According to the research conducted by the Oxford University that more than 80% students admitted they know more about old language such as English and Latin after studying plays many hundred years ago.
To conclude, I am strongly convinced that studying old plays centuries ago for senor school students has more advantageous than disadvantages, based on what has been discussed above.

27.Design of buildings. 建筑设计  

How does the design of a building affect, either positively or negatively, where people work and live?

---
Opinions on the issue of the design of buildings vary widely. Although some individuals hold the view that a good design can make people feel comfortable and happy, others argue that the design of a building has little effect on where people work or live. From my perspective, I firmly believe that people's emotions can be affected by a building's design.
There are many reasons supporting my point of view. The primary reason why I think good designs are necessary is that they have positive effects on our mental health, which can enhance the level of our happiness. Moreover, a fantastic building design can raise people's interests, which can stimulate further investments and economic growth. Furthermore, a well-designed building can reflect our cultural origins and backgrounds. As a consequence, there will be an increasing number of visitors traveling to our city, which could bring us an economic boom. Although the negative impacts brought by the design of buildings - for example, the owners of buildings have to invest more in renovation - should be taken into account, I still believe the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. It is beneficial because those designs can facilitate our work and lives. According to many surveys, people have higher productivity if they work in a well-designed environment.
In conclusion, the design of buildings plays a vital role in our daily lives. Considering what has been discussed, we need joint efforts from schools, policy makers and social groups.

Over the past few years, the design of a building has gradually attracted widespread public attention. When it comes to positive or negative, different people have different points of view. From my perspective, I firmly believe that I agree the design of a building positively affects where people work and live. In this essay, I will analyse the reasons for positively effects and suggest potential solutions.
To begin with, one significant driving cause of individual aspects is the rapid increase of the design of a building. It is essential to maintain a balance between individual motivation and mental health well-being . To be more specific, statistics show that the majority of people prefer living in a designed building rather than normal building. Consequently, it is reasonable to argue that I agree the design of a building positively affects where people work and live.
On the other hand, proponents of positive or negative contend that it is essential to consider societal factors. The design of a building may seem a convenient option at first sight. However, it may lead to undesirable outcomes, if we think about societal factors thoroughly. Moreover, recent studies indicate that there is a close relationship between spending more money on designed building and saving more money for other developments. Therefore, the urgency of emphasising ..cannot be underestimated.
In summary, all these facts provide us with enough support for the idea that I agree the design of a building positively affects where people work and live.

28.Cashless society. 无现金社会  

In a cashless society, people use more credit cards. The cashless society seems to be a reality, and how realistic do you think? What are the advantages and disadvantages of this phenomenon?

---
In recent years , the topic of a cashless society has sparked numerous debates and captured the public 's attention . Some people believe that digital payment methods , such as credit cards, will be a trend in the future. I strongly agree with this viewpoint. I think the advantages of this phenomenon outweigh the disadvantages.
First and foremost , I believe that the individual aspect is a compelling reason for the government to promote a cashless society. It is obvious that online payments offer a range of advantages for users , such as daily shopping and travel . While it is important to consider the potential impact of credit cards , which means there may exist risks that providers collect and sell the user 's information . I still hold the view that digital payments will become realistic in the future. For example , a well - known American socialist once said that digital payments is a signal that our society has become more and more advanced , and technological advancement also makes our lives and works more efficient .
However , the disadvantages of a cashless society should be taken into account. In the first place,improper use of credit cards has resulted in some issues. For example, a study shows that over use of credit cards can cause long-term financial difficulty for people. In the second place, it is evident that the drawbacks of digital payments need to be managed to minimum safety risks. As a result, the local governments and corporations should make an effort to reach a consensus and make sure the situation will develop in the right direction.
In conclusion,although there are still some different viewpoints on the above topic. I still believe that a cashless society will become more and more realistic.

In today's complex society, numerous issues spark considerable debate. One such topic is the cashless society. While it is true that every issue has both advantages and disadvantages, my viewpoint is that the benefits of the cashless society outweigh the drawbacks. This essay will examine both perspectives and demonstrate a reasoned conclusion.
Firstly, I believe that it is realistic that our society has become cashless, as we can use digital payment methods such as credit cards and Paypal to finish the majority of transactions in our daily lives, regardless of online shopping or offline purchases.
On the one hand, some people argue that this phenomenon can contribute to problems regarding financial security. This is because the money in our digital pockets is not tangible, which has the potential for a big financial loss. For example, we may not be aware if the money is stolen and then transferred to another account. Therefore, it is understandable why many people support this idea.
On the other hand, I firmly believe that the cashless society provides us with great convenience. This means people can make payments much easier and effortless without carrying a physical cash. For instance, a recent study from the University of Sydney reveals that the digital payments can boost more transactions and customer satisfaction.
In conclusion, although the cashless society may arise some problems, the overall benefits it brings are more substantial. As a result, it remains a positive force in our modern lives.

29.Effective learning. 有效学习  

Studying effectively requires comfort, peace, and time. So a student can't combine learning and employment at the same time because one distracts the other. Is it realistic to combine them at the same time? Support your opinion with examples.

---
In contemporary times, the issue of effective studying has sparked considerable debate and attracted widespread public interest. While some advocate the view that a student can't combine learning and employment at the same time beacuse one distracts the other, others firmly contend that they can be combined at the same time. As far as I am concerned, I align myself with the latter opinion.
First and foremost, there are numerous reasons for the importance of learning and employment at the same time, the most notable of which is that it can improve comprehensive abilities. Although potentially negative impacts of time and energy should be taken into account, I still reckon that learning and employment at the same time generates more benefits than drawbacks, thereby enormously enriching people's lives in various ways. For example, a prominent American sociologist once revealed that over 76% of students would choose to combine learning and employment at the same time, making it the best choice for them.
Moreover, it is believed by some individuals that it is realistic to combine them at the same time, because students need to learn time management. This perspective reinforces the critical fact that time management plays a vital role in universities all the time. For instance, one of my friends named Anna got a job at school, but she had an excellent academic performance.
In light of the above arguments, it becomes evident that a student can combine learning and employment at the same time. This conclusion underscores its multifaceted significance and enduring influence as discussed.

In recent years, the topic of whether studying effectively requires comfort, peace, and time has sparked numerous debates and captured the attention of the public. Some people argue that a student can't combine learning and employment at the same time because one distracts the other, and I agree with this viewpoint for both individual and societal reasons. In addition, I think that it is realistic to combine them at the same time.
First and foremost, I believe the individual aspect is a compelling reason for students to promote the development of studying effectively. While it is important to consider the potential negative impacts of mutual distraction, I still hold the view that combining learning and employment at the same time can bring many benefits to our society. For example, a well-known American scientist once said that combining learning and employment at the same time can make our lives more efficient. As a matter of fact, based on my own experience, I think that combining learning and employment at the same time can make me more responsible.
In addition, societal factors should also be taken into account when evaluating the significance of studying effectively. From the perspective of governments, their ultimate goal is to maintain and promote the well-being of society. Therefore, studying effectively should play an important role in the overall prosperity of our communities. For instance, recent research published in The Economist revealed that more than half of the respondents think the government should recognize the importance of studying effectively and provide more financial support.
In conclusion, I firmly believe that the advantages of combining learning and employment at the same time outweigh the disadvantages. To tackle this issue, both individuals and society as a whole should join forces and make a concerted effort.

30.Medical technology. 医疗技术  

Medical technology is responsible for increasing average life expectancy. Is it a blessing or a curse?

---
In recent years, the topic of whether medical technology is responsible for the rise in average life expectancy has sparked a heated debate and drawn public attention. Some argue that this phenomenon is beneficial, whereas others insist that it causes negative effects on society. After thoroughly considering all relevant factors, I am convinced that medical technology that increases the average life expectancy is a blessing for all of us.
First and foremost, I believe the individual aspect is a compelling reason for medical technology to account for the average life expectancy. While it is important to consider the potential negative impacts of medical technology, I still hold the view that medical technology allows people to live longer. For example, a prominent doctor once emphasized that many serious diseases have now been eradicated due to advanced medical technology.
Additionally, societal factors should also be taken into account when evaluating the significance of medical technology. As far as I am concerned, the ultimate aim of developing medical technology is to maintain and promote the well-being of society. Therefore, medical technology should play an important role in the overall prosperity of our communities. For instance, a recent study published in a reputable journal reveals that advanced medical technology can improve the quality of life.
In conclusion, based on the above arguments, I firmly believe that medical technology increasing the average lifespan is a blessing. To move things forward, all parties involved must make a concerted effort to communicate and start changing.

Nowadays, many headlines hit the newspaper on the topic of medical technology. This issue has sparked a huge debate on whether medical technology can significantly extend human’s life. From my perspective, I believe that the advantages of medical technology outweigh the disadvantages. On the one hand, there are numerous solid reasons why medical technology is a blessing.
For example, extended life can be pulled into relationships with family members. Although potentially negative impacts of medical technology should be taken into account, which means prolonged life expectancy can impose higher financial burden on the government, I still reckon that medical technology has, in many words, enormously enriched our lives. For instance, a well-known American socialist once said that prolonged life expectancy can boost the development of the aged care industry. Moreover, prolonged life expectancy ensures better cultural heritage. On the other hand, those who argue against medical technology is a curse hold a different opinion.
In the first place, it can be claimed that extended life may reduce the employment rate. In the second place, as far as society is concerned, the ultimate aim of governments is to maintain and promote the well-being of society. As a result, local governments and international organizations should make a joint effort to make sure that this situation will develop in the right direction. In conclusion, while there are many strong arguments on both sides, I still firmly believe that medical technology is a blessing for the whole society.
