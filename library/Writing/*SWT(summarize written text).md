1.Labor comparative advantage. 劳动力比较优势  

With an abundance of low-priced labor relative to the United States, it is no surprise that China, India and other developing countries specialize in the production of labor-intensive products. For similar reasons, the United States will specialize in the production of goods that are human and physical-capital intensive because of the relative abundance of a highly educated labor force and technically sophisticated equipment in the United States.
The division of global production should yield a higher global output of both types of goods than would be the case if each country attempted to produce both of these goods itself. For example, the United States would produce more expensive labor-intensive goods because of its more expensive labor and the developing countries would produce more expensive human and physical capital-intensive goods because of their relative scarcity of these inputs. This logic implies that the United States is unlikely to be a significant global competitor in the production of green technologies that are not relatively intensive in human and physical capital.
Nevertheless, during the early stages of the development of new technology, the United States had a comparative advantage in the production of the products enabled by this innovation. However, once these technologies become well-understood and production processes are designed that can make use of less-skilled labor; production will migrate to countries with less expensive labor.

2.Nobel peace prize. 诺贝尔和平奖  

This year's Nobel Peace Prize justly rewards the thousands of scientists of the United Nations Climate Change Panel the IPCC. These scientists are engaged in excellent, painstaking work that establishes exactly what the world should expect from climate change.
The other award winner, former US Vice President Al Gore, has spent much more time telling us what to fear. While the IPCC's estimates and conclusions are grounded in careful study, Gore doesn't seem to be similarly restrained.
Gore told the world in his Academy Award-winning movie recently labeled"one-sided" and containing scientific errors by a British judge to expect 20 foot sea-level rises over this century. He ignores the findings of his Nobel co-winners, the IPCC, who conclude that sea levels will rise between only a half foot and two feet over this century, with their best expectation being about one foot. That's similar to what the world experienced over the past 150 years.
Likewise, Gore agonizes over the accelerated melting of ice in Greenland and what it means for the planet but overlooks the IPCC's conclusion that, if sustained, the current rate of melting would add just three inches to the sea level rise by the end of the century.
Gore also takes no notice of research showing that Greenlands temperatures were higher in 1941 than they are today. Gore also frets about the future of polar bears. He claims they are drowning as their icy habitat disappears. However, the only scientific study showing any such thing indicates that four polar bears drowned because of a storm.
The politician turned movie maker loses sleep over a predicted rise in heat-related deaths. There's another side of the story that's inconvenient to mention rising temperatures will reduce the number of cold spells, which are a much bigger killer than heat. The best study shows that by 2050, heat will claim 400, 000 more lives, but 1. 8 million fewer will die because of cold. Indeed, according to the first complete survey of the economic effects of climate change on the world, global warming will actually save lives.

3.Coffee House in London. 伦敦咖啡馆  

Who would have thought back in 1698, as they downed their espressos, that the little band of stockbrokers from Jonathan's Coffee House in Change Alley EC3 would be the founder members of what would become the world's mighty money capital?
Progress was not entirely smooth. The South Sea Bubble burst in 1720, and the coffee house exchanges burned down in 1748. As late as the Big Bang in 1986, when bowler hats were finally hung up, you wouldn't have bet the farm on London surpassing New York, Frankfurt, and Tokyo as Mammon's international nexus.
Yet the 325, 000 souls who operate in the UK capital's financial hub have now overtaken their New York rivals in the size of the funds managed including offshore business they hold 70 of the global secondary bond market and the City dominates foreign exchange trading. And its institutions paid out 9 billion in bonuses in December. The Square Mile has now spread both eastwards from EC3 to Canary Wharf and westwards into Mayfair, where many of the private equity locusts and their hedge fund pals now hang out.
For foreigners in finance, London is the place to be. It has no Sarbanes Oxley and no euro to hold it back, yet the fact that it still flies so high is against the odds. London is one of the most expensive cities in the world to live in, transport systems groan, and there's an ever-present threat of terrorist attacks. But, for the time being, the deals just keep on getting bigger.

4.Beauty contest in Australia. 澳大利亚选美比赛  

Since Australians Jennifer Hawkins and Lauryn Eagle were crowned Miss Universe and Miss Teen International respectively, there has been a dramatic increase in interest in beauty pageants in this country. These wins have also sparked a debate as to whether beauty pageants are just harmless reminders of old-fashioned values or a throwback to the days when women were respected for how good they looked.
Opponents argue that beauty pageants, whether it's Miss Universe or Miss Teen International, are demeaning to women and out of sync with the times. They say they are nothing more than symbols of decline.
In the past few decades, Australia has taken more than a few faltering steps toward treating women with dignity and respect. Young women are being brought up knowing that they can do anything, as shown by inspiring role models in medicine such as 2003 Australian of the Year Professor Fiona Stanley.
In the 1960s and 70s, one of the first acts of the feminist movement was to picket beauty pageants on the premise that the industry promoted the view that it was acceptable to judge women on their appearance. Today many young Australian women are still profoundly uncomfortable with their body image, feeling under all kinds of pressure because they are judged by how they look.
Almost all of the pageant victors are wafer-thin, reinforcing the message that thin equals beautiful. This ignores the fact that men and women come in all sizes and shapes. In a country where up to 60 of young women are on a diet at any one time, and 70 of school girls say they want to lose weight, despite the fact that most have a normal BMI, such messages are profoundly hazardous to the mental health of young Australians.

5.Technology prediction IBM. IBM技术预测  

As far as prediction is concerned, remember that the chairman of IBM predicted in the fifties that the world would need a maximum of around half a dozen computers, and the British Department for Education seemed to think in the eighties that we would all need to be able to code in BASIC and that in the nineties Microsoft failed to foresee the rapid growth of the Internet.
Who could have predicted that one major effect of the automobile would be to bankrupt small shops across the nation? Could the early developers of the telephone have foreseen its development as a medium for person-to-person communication, rather than as a form of broadcasting medium? We all, including the experts, seem to be peculiarly inept at predicting the likely development of our technologies, even as far as the next year. We can, of course, try to extrapolate from the experience of previous technologies, as I do below by comparing the technology of the Internet with the development of other information and communication technologies and by examining the earlier development of radio and print.
But how justified I might be in doing so remains an open question. You might conceivably find the history of the British and French videotext systems, Prestel and Minitel, instructive. However, I am not entirely convinced that they are very relevant, nor do I know where you can find information about them online, so, rather than take up space here, I've briefly described them in a separate article.

6.Children watching TV. 儿童看电视  

Why and to what extent should parents control their children's TV watching? There is certainly nothing inherently wrong with TV. The problem is how much television a child watches and what effect it has on his life. Research has shown that as the amount of time spent watching TV goes up, the amount of time devoted not only to homework and study but other important aspects of life such as social development and physical activities decreases.
Television is bound to have a tremendous impact on a child, both in terms of how many hours a week he watches TV and of what he sees. When a parent is concerned about the effects of television, he should consider a number of things that TV offers the child in terms of information and knowledge, how many hours a week a youngster his age should watch television, the impact of violence and sex, and the influence of commercials.
What about the family as a whole? Is the TV set a central piece of furniture in your home? Is it picked on the moment someone enters the empty house? Is it on during the daytime? Is it part of the background noise of your family life? Do you demonstrate by your own viewing that television should be watched selectively?

7.Namibia. 纳米比亚  

When Namibia gained independence in 1990, teenager Pascolena Florry was herding goats in the country's dry, desolate northern savannah. Her job, unpaid and dangerous, was to protect her parents livestock from preying jackals and leopards. She saw wildlife as the enemy, and many of the other indigenous inhabitants of Namibia's rural communal lands shared her view. Wildlife poaching was commonplace. Fifteen years later, 31 year-old Pascolena's life and outlook are very different. She has built a previously undreamed career in tourism and is the first black Namibian to be appointed a manager of a guest lodge. Her village and hundreds of others have directly benefited from government efforts to devolve management and tourism development on communal lands to conservancies run by indigenous peoples. Now we seewildlife as our way of creating jobs and opportunities as the tourism industry grows, she says. The future is better with wildlife around, not only for jobs but also for the environment.

8.Armed Police. 武装警察  

Armed police have been brought into NSW schools to reduce crime rates and educate students. The 40 School Liaison Police( SLP) officers have been allocated to public and private high schools across the state.
Organizers say the officers, who began work last week, will build positive relationships between police and students. But parent groups warned of the potential dangers of armed police working at schools in communities where police relations were already under strain.
Among their duties, the SLPs will conduct crime prevention workshops, talking to students about issues including shoplifting, offensive behavior, graffiti and drugs, and alcohol. They can also advise school principals. One SLP, Constable Ben Purvis, began work in the inner Sydney region last week, including at Alexandria Park Community Schools senior campus. Previously stationed as a crime prevention officer at The Rocks, he now has 27 schools under his jurisdiction in areas including The Rocks, Redfern and Kings Cross.
Constable Purvis said the full-time position would see him working on the broader issues of crime prevention. I am not a security guard, he said. I am not there to patrol the school. We want to improve relationships between police and schoolchildren, to have a positive interaction. We are coming to the school and giving them the knowledge to improve their own safety."The use of fake ID among older students is among the issues he has already discussed with principals. Parents groups responded to the program positively but said it might spark a range of community reactions." It is a good thing, and an innovative idea and there could be some positive benefits,"Council of Catholic School Parents executive officer Danielle Cronin said." Different communities will respond to this kind of presence in different ways.

9.Grass and cow. 草与牛  

The co-evolutionary relationship between cows and grass is one of nature's underappreciated wonders; it also happens to be the key to understanding just about everything about modern meat. For the grasses, which have evolved to withstand the grazing of ruminants, the cow maintains and expands their habitat by preventing trees and shrubs from gaining a foothold and hogging the sunlight; the animal also spreads grass seed, plants it with his hooves, and then fertilizes it with his manure. In exchange for these services, the grasses offer ruminants a plentiful and exclusive supply of lunch. Cows( like sheep, bison, and other ruminants) have evolved the special ability to convert grass which single-stomached creatures like us can't digest into high-quality protein. They can do this because they possess what is surely the most highly evolved digestive organ in nature: the rumen. About the size of a medicine ball, the organ is essentially a forty-five-gallon fermentation tank in which a resident population of bacteria dines on grass. Living their unseen lives at the far end of the food chain that culminates in a hamburger, these bacteria have, just like the grasses, coevolved with the cow, whom they feed. Truly this is an excellent system for all concerned: for the grasses, for the bacteria, for the animals, and for us, the animals eaters.

10.Songbirds. 鸣禽  

Males do the singing and females do the listening. This has been the established, even cherished view of courtship in birds, but now some ornithologists are changing the tune.
Lszl Garamszegi of the University of Antwerp, Belgium, and colleagues studied the literature on 233 European songbird species. Of the 109 for which information on females was available, they found evidence for singing in 101 species. In only eight species could the team conclude that females did not sing?
Females that sing have been overlooked, the team says, because their songs are quiet, they are mistaken for males from their similar plumage, or they live in less well-studied areas such as the tropics. Garamszegi blames Charles Darwin for the oversight. He emphasized the importance of male sexual display, and this is what everyone has been looking at.
The findings go beyond modern species. After carefully tracing back an evolutionary family tree for their songbirds, the Garamszegis team discovered that, in at least two bird families, singing evolved in females first. They suggest these ancient females may have been using their songs to deter other females from their territories, to coordinate breeding activities with males, or possibly to attract mates.

11.Parent's born order. 父母出生顺序  

Parents own birth order can become an issue when dynamics in the family they are raising replicate the family in which they were raised. Agati notes common examples, such as a firstborn parent getting into"raging battles" with a firstborn child."Both are used to getting the last word. Each has to be right. But the parent has to be the grown-up and step out of that battle," he advises. When youngest children become parents, Agati cautions that because they"may not have had high expectations placed on them, they, in turn, may not see their kids for their abilities."
But he also notes that since youngest children tend to be more social,"youngest parents can be helpful to their firstborn, who may have a harder time with social situations. These parents can help their eldest kids loosen up and not be so hard on themselves. Mom Susan Ritz says her own birth order didn't seem to affect her parenting until the youngest of her three children, Julie, was born. Julie was nine years younger than Ritz's oldest, Joshua, mirroring the age difference between Susan and her own older brother." I would see Joshua do to Julie what my brother did to me," she says of the taunting and teasing by a much older sibling.
"I had to try not to always take Julie's side." Biases can surface no matter what your own birth position was, as Lori Silverstone points out."As a middle myself, I can be harder on my older daughter. I recall my older sister hitting me," she says of her reactions to her daughters tussles.

12.Living in countryside. 乡村生活  

I knew it was a good idea because I had been there before. Born and reared on a farm I had been seduced for a few years by the idea of being a big shot who lived and worked in a city rather than only going for the day to wave at the buses. True, I was familiar with some of the minor disadvantages of country living such as an iffy private water supply sometimes infiltrated by a range of flora and fauna-including, on one memorable occasion, a dead lamb, the absence of central heating in farmhouses and cottages, and a single-track farm road easily blocked by snow, broken-down machinery or escaped livestock.
But there were many advantages as I told Liz back in the mid-Seventies. Town born and bred, eight months pregnant and exchanging a warm, substantial Corstorphine terrace for a windswept farm cottage on a much lower income, persuading her that country had it over town might have been difficult.

13.Napping. 午睡  

Could midday napping save your life?
If the experience of Greek men is any guide, the answer just maybe yes.
In a study released yesterday, researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health and in Athens reported that Greeks who took regular 30 minute siestas were 37 percent less likely to die of heart disease over six year than those who never napped. The scientists tracked more than 23, 000 adults, finding that the benefits of napping were most pronounced for workers.
Researchers have long recognized that Mediterranean adults die of heart disease at a rate lower than Americans and Northern Europeans. Diets rich in olive oil and other heart-healthy foods have received some of the credit, but scientists have been intrigued by the potential role of napping.
The study, published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, concluded that napping was more likely than diet or physical activity to lower the incidence of heart attacks and other life-ending heart ailments.
Still, the authors cautioned that further research is needed to confirm their findings.

14.House mice. 家鼠  

According to new research, house mice( Mus musculus) are ideal biomarkers of human settlement as they tend to stow away in crates or on ships that end up going where people go. Using mice as a proxy for human movement can add to what is already known through archaeological data and answer important questions in areas where there is a lack of artifacts, Searle said.
Where people go, so do mice, often stowing away in carts of hay or on ships. Despite a natural range of just 100 meters( 109 yards) and an evolutionary base near Pakistan, the house mouse has managed to colonize every continent, which makes it a useful tool for researchers like Searle.
Previous research conducted by Searle at the University of York supported the theory that Australian mice originated in the British Isles and probably came over with convicts shipped there to colonize the continent in the late 18th and 19th centuries.
In the Viking study, he and his fellow researchers in Iceland, Denmark and Sweden took it a step further, using ancient mouse DNA collected from archaeological sites dating from the 10th to 12th centuries, as well as modern mice.
He is hoping to do just that in his next project, which involves tracking the migration of mice and other species, including plants, across the Indian Ocean, from South Asia to East Africa.

15.Wine industry in US. 美国葡萄酒产业  

In 1920, the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was enacted, creating yet another serious setback to the American wine industry. The National Prohibition Act, also known as the Volstead Act, prohibited the manufacture, sale, transportation, importation, exportation, delivery, or possession of intoxicating liquors for beverage purposes, and nearly destroyed what had become a thriving national industry. In 1920 there were more than seven hundred wineries in California. By the end of Prohibition, there were 160.
If Prohibition had lasted only four or five years, its impact on the wine industry might have been negligible. But it continued for thirteen years, during which time grapes went underground literally and figuratively, becoming an important commodity in the criminal economy. The fruit juice, which was sometimes made into concentrate, was ideal for making wine. Some of this yield found its way to bootleggers throughout America who did just that. But not for long, because the government stepped in and banned the sale of grape juice, preventing illegal wine production. Vineyards stopped being planted, and the American wine industry ground to a halt.

16.South African. 南非人  

At around 2300 BP( Before Present), hunter-gatherers called the San acquired domestic stock in what is now modern-day Botswana. Their population grew and spread throughout the Western half of South Africa. They were the first pastoralists in southern Africa, and called themselves Khoikhoi( or Khoe), which means men of men or the real people. This name was chosen to show pride in their past and culture. The Khoikhoi brought a new way of life to South Africa and to the San, who were hunter-gatherers as opposed to herders. This led to misunderstandings and subsequent conflict between the two groups.
The Khoikhoi were the first native people to come into contact with the Dutch settlers in the mid 17th century. As the Dutch took over land for farms, the Khoikhoi were dispossessed, exterminated, or enslaved and therefore their numbers dwindled. The Khoikhoi were called the Hottentots by European settlers because the sound of their language was so different from any European language, and they could not pronounce many of the words and sounds.

17.Non-human animals and humans. 非人类动物与人类  

All non-human animals are constrained by the tools that nature has bequeathed them through natural selection. They are not capable of striving towards truth they simply absorb information and behave in ways useful for their survival. The kinds of knowledge they require of the world have been largely pre-selected by evolution. No animal is capable of asking questions or generating problems that are irrelevant to its immediate circumstances or its evolutionarily designed needs. When a beaver builds a dam, it doesn't ask itself why it does so, or whether there is a better way of doing it. When a swallow flies south, it doesn't wonder why it is hotter in Africa or what would happen if it flew still further south.
Humans do ask themselves these and many other kinds of questions, questions that have no relevance and, indeed make little sense, in the context of evolved needs and goals. What marks out humans is our capacity to go beyond our naturally defined goals such as the need to find food, shelter, or a mate, and to establish humanly created goals.
Some contemporary thinkers believe that there are indeed certain questions that humans are incapable of answering because of our evolved nature. Steven Pinker, for instance, argues that"Our minds evolved by natural selection to solve problems that were life and death matters to our ancestors, not to commune with correctness or to answer any question we are capable of asking. We cannot hold ten thousand words in our short-term memory. We cannot see the ultraviolet light. We cannot mentally rotate an object in the fourth dimension. And perhaps we cannot solve conundrums like free will and sentience."

18.US and Indian engineers. 美国和印度工程师  

Considering the current situation like their counterparts in the United States, engineers, and technicians in India have the capacity to provide both computer programming and innovative new technologies. Indian programmers and high-tech engineers earn one-quarter of what their counterparts earn in the United States, Consequently, India is able to do both jobs at a lower dollar cost than the United States India has an absolute advantage in both. In other words, it can produce a unit of programming for fewer dollars than the United States, and it can also produce a unit of technology innovation for fewer dollars. Does that mean that the United States will lose not only programming jobs but innovative technology jobs, too? Does that mean that our standard of living will fall if the United States and India engage in international trade?
David Ricardo would have answered no to both questions as we do today. While India may have an absolute advantage in both activities, that fact is irrelevant in determining what India or the United States will produce. India has a comparative advantage in doing programming in part because such activity requires little physical capital. The flip side is that the United States has a comparative advantage in technology innovation partly because it is relatively easy to obtain capital in this country to undertake such long-run projects. The result is that Indian programmers will do more and more of what U. S. programmers have been doing in the past. In contrast, American firms will shift to more and more innovation.

19.Australian education. 澳大利亚教育  

When Australians engage in debate about educational quality or equity, they often seem to accept that a country cannot achieve both at the same time.
Curriculum reforms intended to improve equity often fail to do so because they increase breadth or differentiation in offerings in a way that increases differences in quality. Further, these differences in quality often reflect differences in student's social backgrounds because the new offerings are typically taken up by relatively disadvantaged students who are not served well them. Evidence from New South Wales will be used to illustrate this point.
The need to improve the quality of education is well accepted across OECD and other countries as they seek to strengthen their human capital to underpin their modern, knowledge economies. Improved equity is also important for this purpose since the demand for high-level skills is widespread and the opportunities for the low skilled are diminishing.
Improved equity in education is also important for social cohesion. There are countries in which the education system seems primarily to reproduce existing social arrangements, conferring privilege where it already exists and denying it where it does not. Even in countries where the diagnosis might be less extreme, the capacity of schooling to build social cohesion is often diminished by the way in which schools separate individuals and groups.

20.Tourism industry. 旅游业  

Jobs generated by Travel Tourism are spread across the economy in retail, construction, manufacturing, and telecommunications, as well as directly in Travel Tourism companies. These jobs employ a large proportion of women, minorities and young people are predominantly small and medium-sized companies and offer good training and transferability. Tourism can also be one of the most effective drivers for the development of regional economies. These patterns apply to both developed and emerging economies.
There are numerous good examples of where Travel Tourism is acting as a catalyst for conservation and improvement of the environment and maintenance of local diversity and culture. Travel Tourism creates jobs and wealth and has tremendous potential to contribute to economically, environmentally and socially sustainable development in both developed countries and emerging nations. It has a comparative advantage in that its start-up and running costs can be low compared to many other forms of industrial development. It is also often one of the few realistic options for development in many areas. Therefore, there is a strong likelihood that the Travel Tourism industry will continue to grow globally over the short to medium term.

21.Aging world. 老龄化世界  

We live in an aging world. While this has been recognized for some time in developed countries, it is only recently that this phenomenon has been fully acknowledged. Global communication is"shrinking" the world, and global aging is"maturing" it. The increasing presence of older persons in the world is making people of all ages more aware that we live in a diverse and multigenerational society. It is no longer possible to ignore aging, regardless of whether one views it positively or negatively.
Demographers note that if current trends in aging continue as predicted, a demographic revolution, wherein the proportions of the young and the old will undergo a historic crossover, will be felt in just three generations. This portrait of change in the world's population parallels the magnitude of the industrial revolution traditionally considered the most significant social and economic breakthrough in the history of humankind since the Neolithic period. It marked the beginning of a sustained movement towards modern economic growth in much the same way that globalization is today marking an unprecedented and sustained movement toward a"global culture". The demographic revolution, it is envisaged, will be at least as powerful.
While the future effects are not known, a likely scenario is one where both the challenges as well as the opportunities will emerge from a vessel into which exploration and research, dialogue and debate are poured. Challenges arise as social and economic structures try to adjust to the simultaneous phenomenon of diminishing young cohorts with rising older ones, and opportunities present themselves in the sheer number of older individuals and the vast resources societies stand to gain from their contribution.

We live in an aging world and it is no longer possible to ignore aging, and the portrait of change in the world 's population parallels the magnitude of the industrial revolution traditionally considered the most significant social, so chances present themselves in the sheer number of older individuals and the huge resources societies stand to gain from their disbursement.

22.Human remains. 人类遗骸  

Human remains are a fundamental part of the archaeological record, offering unique insights into the lives of individuals and populations in the past. Like many archaeological materials, human remains require distinctive and specialized methods of recovery, analysis, and interpretation, while technological innovations and the accumulation of expertise have enabled archaeologists to extract ever greater amounts of information from assemblages of skeletal material. Alongside analyses of new finds, these advances have consistently thrown new light on existing collections of human remains in museums, universities and other institutions. Given the powerful emotional, social and religious meanings attached to the dead body, it is perhaps unsurprising that human remains pose a distinctive set of ethical questions for archaeologists.
With the rise of indigenous rights movements and the emergence of post-colonial nations, the acquisition and ownership of human remains became a divisive and politically loaded issue. It became increasingly clear that many human remains in museum collections around the world represented the traces of colonial exploitation and discredited pseudo-scientific theories of race. In the light of these debates and changing attitudes, some human remains were returned or repatriated to their communities of origin, a process that continues to this day. Recently a new set of challenges to the study of human remains has emerged from a rather unexpected direction: the British government revised its interpretation of nineteenth-century burial legislation in a way that would drastically curtail the ability of archaeologists to study human remains of any age excavated in England and Wales. This paper examines these extraordinary events and the legal, political and ethical questions that they raise.

23.Resonance theory. 共振理论  

The history of marketers seeking the advice of physicists is a short one, but an understanding of the Theory of Resonance may give communications experts the edge. Resonance Theory explains the curious phenomenon of how very small pebbles dropped into a pond can create bigger waves than a large brick. The brick makes a decent splash but its ripples peter out quickly. A tiny pebble dropped into the same pond, followed by another, then another, then another, all timed carefully, will create ripples that build into small waves.
As Dr Carlo Contaldi, a physicist at Imperial College London, explains, a small amount of energy committed at just the right intervals the natural frequency creates a cumulatively large effect. Media consultant Paul Bay believes that just as with pebbles in a pond, a carefully choreographed and meticulously timed stream of communication will have a more lasting effect than a sporadic big splash during prime-time TV breaks. So whether you're trying to make waves in the laboratory or in the media, the people in white coats would advise a little and often. A big budget is not the prerequisite for success.

24.School resource officer. 学校资源官员  

Spurred by the sense that disorderly behavior among students in South Euclid was increasing, the school resource officer( SRO) reviewed data regarding referrals to the principal's office. He found that the high school reported thousands of referrals a year for bullying and that the junior high school had recently experienced a 30 percent increase in bullying referrals. Police data showed that juvenile complaints about disturbances, bullying, and assaults after school hours had increased by 90 percent in the past ten years.
The SRO worked in close collaboration with a social worker and a university researcher. They coordinated a Response Planning Team comprising many stakeholders that were intended to respond to each of the areas identified in the initial analysis. Environmental changes included modifying the school schedule and increasing teacher supervision of hotspots. Counselors and social workers conducted teacher training courses in conflict resolution and bullying prevention. Parent education included mailings with information about bullying, an explanation of the new school policy, and a discussion about what could be done at home to address the problems. Finally, student education included classroom discussions between homeroom teachers and students, as well as assemblies conducted by the SRO. The SRO also opened a substation next to a primary hotspot. The Ohio Department of Education contributed by opening a new training center to provide a non-traditional setting for specialized help.
The results from the various responses were dramatic. School suspensions decreased by 40 percent. Bullying incidents dropped 60 percent in the hallways and 80 percent in the gym area. Follow-up surveys indicated that there were positive attitudinal changes among students about bullying and that more students felt confident that teachers would take action when a problem arose. Teachers indicated that training sessions were helpful and that they were more likely to talk about bullying as a serious issue. Parents responded positively, asking for more information about the problem in future mailings. The overall results suggest that the school environments were not only safer but that early intervention was helping at-risk students succeed in school.

25.Tree ring. 年轮  

Here's how tree-ring dating, known to scientists as dendrochronology works. If you cut a tree down today, it's straightforward to count the rings inwards, starting from the trees outside( corresponding to this year's growth ring), and thereby to state that the 177th ring from the outermost one towards the center was laid down in the year 2005 minus 177, or 1828. But it's less straightforward to attach a date to a particular ring in an ancient Anasazi wooden beam because at first, you don't know in what year the beam was cut. However, the widths of tree growth rings vary from year to year, depending on the rain or drought conditions in each year.
Hence the sequence of the rings in a tree cross-section is like a message in Morse code formerly used for sending telegraph messages dot-dot-dash dot-dash in the Morse code, wide-wide-narrow wide-narrow in the tree ring sequence. Actually, the tree ring sequence is even more diagnostic and richer in information than the Morse code, because trees actually contain rings spanning many different widths, rather than the Morse code choice between dot and dash.
Tree-ring specialists( known as dendrochronologists) proceed by noting the sequence of wider and narrower rings in a tree cut down in a known recent year, and also noting the sequences in beams from trees cut down at various times in the past. They then match up and align the tree ring sequences with the same diagnostic wide, narrow patterns from different beams.
In that way, dendrochronologists have constructed tree-ring records extending back for thousands of years in some parts of the world. Each record is valid for a geographic area whose extent depends on local weather patterns because weather and hence tree growth patterns vary with location. For instance, the basic tree-ring chronology of the American Southwest applies( with some variation) to the area from Northern Mexico to Wyoming.

26.Greenhouse gas. 温室气体  

When an individual drives a car, heats a house or uses an aerosol hairspray, greenhouse gases are produced. In economic terms, this creates a classic negative externality. Most of the cost is borne by individuals other than the one making the decision about how many miles to drive or how much hairspray to use. Because the driver or sprayer enjoys all the benefits of the activities but suffers only part of the cost, that individual engages in more than the economically efficient amount of the activity. In this sense, the problem of greenhouse gases parallels the problem that occurs when someone smokes a cigarette in an enclosed space or litters the countryside with fast-food wrappers. If we are to get individuals to reduce the production of greenhouse gases to an efficient rate, we must somehow induce them to act as though they bear all the costs of their actions. The two most widely accepted means of doing this are government regulation and taxation, both of which have been proposed to deal with greenhouse gases.

27.Written language. 书面语言  

The world engages in improving the literacy of reading and writing, but it is not that important now. What is a text-written language anyway? It is an accident IT for storing and retrieving information. We store information by writing it, and we retrieve it by reading it. 6000 to 10, 000 years ago, many of our ancestor's hunter-gatherer societies settled on the land and began what's known as the agricultural revolution. That new land settlement led to private property and increased production and trade of goods, generating a huge new influx of information. Unable to keep all this in their memories, our ancestors created systems of written records that evolved over millennia into today's written language. But this ancient IT is already becoming obsolete. The text has run its historical course and is now rapidly getting replaced in every area of our lives by the ever-increasing emerging IT driven by voice, video, and body movement rather than the written word. In my view, this is a positive step forward in the evolution of human technology, and it carries great potential for a total positive redesign of education. Written language is an ancient IT for storing and retrieving information. However, the written word is becoming obsolete and is now rapidly getting replaced by voice, video and body movement, which is believed a positive step forward in the evolution of human technology and redesign of education.

28.Office environment. 办公环境  

The notion that office space has a role in promoting or inhibiting performance is backed up by solid research. A recent study conducted by Harvard University and Massachusetts General Hospital showed that improvements to the physical surroundings of workers impacted productivity not just because the working environment was more attractive, but because the changes made employees feel cared for. A Swedish research paper revealed a strong link between the type of office an employee worked in and their overall job satisfaction and health.
Various findings have emerged as a result of studies such as this. Pot plants and greenery can apparently have a real impact on psychological well-being. Those who work in a private room tend to be in better health than workers based in open-plan offices. Sufficient light can reduce sickness among workers and increase productivity, and an attractive office can make workers feel more cared for and therefore more loyal to their company.
Most of these points make good rational sense. But some companies aren't content simply to increase the health, productivity, and contentment of their employees. Pioneers such as Google, Walt Disney, and Dyson have tried to create offices that will do everything from promoting collaboration between workers to stimulating their creative juices.
"Environment, both physical and cultural, can make or break creativity", says Kursty Groves, author of I Wish I Worked There! A look inside the most creative spaces in business. Stimulating spaces expose the mind to a variety of stimuli, planned or random. In order to encourage people to think differently. Reflective spaces promote the filtering of information into the brain slowing it to make connections. An environment that encourages a team to build trust and to play freely is an essential ingredient for innovation.

29.The Wright brothers. 莱特兄弟  

Orville and Wilbur Wright were brothers living in Dayton, Ohio. The two had started making bicycles during the 1890s and had a successful small business selling their Wright Specials for 18 each( 475 in today's green). This experience with building light, strong machines would prove valuable in the coming years after the brothers interest turned to flight. Others in the United States were also developing aircraft at the time the Wright brothers started turning their curiosity skyward. Samuel Langley had flown an unmanned steam-powered aircraft in 1896. Octave Chanute and others were flying gliders near Chicago late in the decade as well. But it wasn't until the Wright brothers started working on the matter that the flying problem would finally be solved. Beginning in 1899, the brothers designed and built a series of gliders to test their various ideas on a flying machine. They constructed a wind tunnel that allowed them to test designs without having to build a full-size model. They even built their own gasoline-powered motor for their aircraft.

30.Australian indigenous food. 澳大利亚土著食物  

In its periodic quest for culinary identity, Australia automatically looks to its indigenous ingredients, the foods that are native to this country. There can be little doubt that using an indigenous product must qualify a dish as Australian notes, Stephanie Alexander. Similarly, and without qualification, states that a uniquely Australian food culture can only be based on foods indigenous to this country, although, as Craw remarks, proposing Australian native foods as national symbols relies more upon their association with nature and geographic origin than on common usage Notwithstanding the lack of justification for the premise that national dishes are, of necessity, founded on ingredients native to the country. After all, Italy's gastronomic identity is tied to the non-indigenous tomato, Thailand then indigenous chili, and the reality is that Australians do not eat indigenous foods in significant quantities. The exceptions are fish, crustaceans, and shellfish from oceans, rivers, and lakes, most of which are unarguably unique to this country. Despite valiant and well-intentioned efforts today at promoting and encouraging the consumption of native resources, bush foods are not harvested or produced in sufficient quantities for them to be a standard component of Australian diets, nor are they generally accessible. Indigenous foods are less relevant to Australian identity today than lamb and passionfruit, both initially imported and now naturalized.
