1.Labor comparative advantage. 劳动力比较优势  

With an abundance of low-priced labor relative to the United States, it is no surprise that China, India and other developing countries specialize in the production of labor-intensive products. For similar reasons, the United States will specialize in the production of goods that are human and physical-capital intensive because of the relative abundance of a highly educated labor force and technically sophisticated equipment in the United States.
The division of global production should yield a higher global output of both types of goods than would be the case if each country attempted to produce both of these goods itself. For example, the United States would produce more expensive labor-intensive goods because of its more expensive labor and the developing countries would produce more expensive human and physical capital-intensive goods because of their relative scarcity of these inputs. This logic implies that the United States is unlikely to be a significant global competitor in the production of green technologies that are not relatively intensive in human and physical capital.
Nevertheless, during the early stages of the development of new technology, the United States had a comparative advantage in the production of the products enabled by this innovation. However, once these technologies become well-understood and production processes are designed that can make use of less-skilled labor; production will migrate to countries with less expensive labor.

2.Nobel peace prize. 诺贝尔和平奖  

This year's Nobel Peace Prize justly rewards the thousands of scientists of the United Nations Climate Change Panel the IPCC. These scientists are engaged in excellent, painstaking work that establishes exactly what the world should expect from climate change.
The other award winner, former US Vice President Al Gore, has spent much more time telling us what to fear. While the IPCC's estimates and conclusions are grounded in careful study, Gore doesn't seem to be similarly restrained.
Gore told the world in his Academy Award-winning movie recently labeled"one-sided" and containing scientific errors by a British judge to expect 20 foot sea-level rises over this century. He ignores the findings of his Nobel co-winners, the IPCC, who conclude that sea levels will rise between only a half foot and two feet over this century, with their best expectation being about one foot. That's similar to what the world experienced over the past 150 years.
Likewise, Gore agonizes over the accelerated melting of ice in Greenland and what it means for the planet but overlooks the IPCC's conclusion that, if sustained, the current rate of melting would add just three inches to the sea level rise by the end of the century.
Gore also takes no notice of research showing that Greenlands temperatures were higher in 1941 than they are today. Gore also frets about the future of polar bears. He claims they are drowning as their icy habitat disappears. However, the only scientific study showing any such thing indicates that four polar bears drowned because of a storm.
The politician turned movie maker loses sleep over a predicted rise in heat-related deaths. There's another side of the story that's inconvenient to mention rising temperatures will reduce the number of cold spells, which are a much bigger killer than heat. The best study shows that by 2050, heat will claim 400, 000 more lives, but 1. 8 million fewer will die because of cold. Indeed, according to the first complete survey of the economic effects of climate change on the world, global warming will actually save lives.

3.Coffee House in London. 伦敦咖啡馆  

Who would have thought back in 1698, as they downed their espressos, that the little band of stockbrokers from Jonathan's Coffee House in Change Alley EC3 would be the founder members of what would become the world's mighty money capital?
Progress was not entirely smooth. The South Sea Bubble burst in 1720, and the coffee house exchanges burned down in 1748. As late as the Big Bang in 1986, when bowler hats were finally hung up, you wouldn't have bet the farm on London surpassing New York, Frankfurt, and Tokyo as Mammon's international nexus.
Yet the 325, 000 souls who operate in the UK capital's financial hub have now overtaken their New York rivals in the size of the funds managed including offshore business they hold 70 of the global secondary bond market and the City dominates foreign exchange trading. And its institutions paid out 9 billion in bonuses in December. The Square Mile has now spread both eastwards from EC3 to Canary Wharf and westwards into Mayfair, where many of the private equity locusts and their hedge fund pals now hang out.
For foreigners in finance, London is the place to be. It has no Sarbanes Oxley and no euro to hold it back, yet the fact that it still flies so high is against the odds. London is one of the most expensive cities in the world to live in, transport systems groan, and there's an ever-present threat of terrorist attacks. But, for the time being, the deals just keep on getting bigger.

4.Beauty contest in Australia. 澳大利亚选美比赛  

Since Australians Jennifer Hawkins and Lauryn Eagle were crowned Miss Universe and Miss Teen International respectively, there has been a dramatic increase in interest in beauty pageants in this country. These wins have also sparked a debate as to whether beauty pageants are just harmless reminders of old-fashioned values or a throwback to the days when women were respected for how good they looked.
Opponents argue that beauty pageants, whether it's Miss Universe or Miss Teen International, are demeaning to women and out of sync with the times. They say they are nothing more than symbols of decline.
In the past few decades, Australia has taken more than a few faltering steps toward treating women with dignity and respect. Young women are being brought up knowing that they can do anything, as shown by inspiring role models in medicine such as 2003 Australian of the Year Professor Fiona Stanley.
In the 1960s and 70s, one of the first acts of the feminist movement was to picket beauty pageants on the premise that the industry promoted the view that it was acceptable to judge women on their appearance. Today many young Australian women are still profoundly uncomfortable with their body image, feeling under all kinds of pressure because they are judged by how they look.
Almost all of the pageant victors are wafer-thin, reinforcing the message that thin equals beautiful. This ignores the fact that men and women come in all sizes and shapes. In a country where up to 60 of young women are on a diet at any one time, and 70 of school girls say they want to lose weight, despite the fact that most have a normal BMI, such messages are profoundly hazardous to the mental health of young Australians.

5.Technology prediction IBM. IBM技术预测  

As far as prediction is concerned, remember that the chairman of IBM predicted in the fifties that the world would need a maximum of around half a dozen computers, and the British Department for Education seemed to think in the eighties that we would all need to be able to code in BASIC and that in the nineties Microsoft failed to foresee the rapid growth of the Internet.
Who could have predicted that one major effect of the automobile would be to bankrupt small shops across the nation? Could the early developers of the telephone have foreseen its development as a medium for person-to-person communication, rather than as a form of broadcasting medium? We all, including the experts, seem to be peculiarly inept at predicting the likely development of our technologies, even as far as the next year. We can, of course, try to extrapolate from the experience of previous technologies, as I do below by comparing the technology of the Internet with the development of other information and communication technologies and by examining the earlier development of radio and print.
But how justified I might be in doing so remains an open question. You might conceivably find the history of the British and French videotext systems, Prestel and Minitel, instructive. However, I am not entirely convinced that they are very relevant, nor do I know where you can find information about them online, so, rather than take up space here, I've briefly described them in a separate article.

6.Children watching TV. 儿童看电视  

Why and to what extent should parents control their children's TV watching? There is certainly nothing inherently wrong with TV. The problem is how much television a child watches and what effect it has on his life. Research has shown that as the amount of time spent watching TV goes up, the amount of time devoted not only to homework and study but other important aspects of life such as social development and physical activities decreases.
Television is bound to have a tremendous impact on a child, both in terms of how many hours a week he watches TV and of what he sees. When a parent is concerned about the effects of television, he should consider a number of things that TV offers the child in terms of information and knowledge, how many hours a week a youngster his age should watch television, the impact of violence and sex, and the influence of commercials.
What about the family as a whole? Is the TV set a central piece of furniture in your home? Is it picked on the moment someone enters the empty house? Is it on during the daytime? Is it part of the background noise of your family life? Do you demonstrate by your own viewing that television should be watched selectively?

7.Namibia. 纳米比亚  

When Namibia gained independence in 1990, teenager Pascolena Florry was herding goats in the country's dry, desolate northern savannah. Her job, unpaid and dangerous, was to protect her parents livestock from preying jackals and leopards. She saw wildlife as the enemy, and many of the other indigenous inhabitants of Namibia's rural communal lands shared her view. Wildlife poaching was commonplace. Fifteen years later, 31 year-old Pascolena's life and outlook are very different. She has built a previously undreamed career in tourism and is the first black Namibian to be appointed a manager of a guest lodge. Her village and hundreds of others have directly benefited from government efforts to devolve management and tourism development on communal lands to conservancies run by indigenous peoples. Now we seewildlife as our way of creating jobs and opportunities as the tourism industry grows, she says. The future is better with wildlife around, not only for jobs but also for the environment.

8.Armed Police. 武装警察  

Armed police have been brought into NSW schools to reduce crime rates and educate students. The 40 School Liaison Police( SLP) officers have been allocated to public and private high schools across the state.
Organizers say the officers, who began work last week, will build positive relationships between police and students. But parent groups warned of the potential dangers of armed police working at schools in communities where police relations were already under strain.
Among their duties, the SLPs will conduct crime prevention workshops, talking to students about issues including shoplifting, offensive behavior, graffiti and drugs, and alcohol. They can also advise school principals. One SLP, Constable Ben Purvis, began work in the inner Sydney region last week, including at Alexandria Park Community Schools senior campus. Previously stationed as a crime prevention officer at The Rocks, he now has 27 schools under his jurisdiction in areas including The Rocks, Redfern and Kings Cross.
Constable Purvis said the full-time position would see him working on the broader issues of crime prevention. I am not a security guard, he said. I am not there to patrol the school. We want to improve relationships between police and schoolchildren, to have a positive interaction. We are coming to the school and giving them the knowledge to improve their own safety."The use of fake ID among older students is among the issues he has already discussed with principals. Parents groups responded to the program positively but said it might spark a range of community reactions." It is a good thing, and an innovative idea and there could be some positive benefits,"Council of Catholic School Parents executive officer Danielle Cronin said." Different communities will respond to this kind of presence in different ways.

9.Grass and cow. 草与牛  

The co-evolutionary relationship between cows and grass is one of nature's underappreciated wonders; it also happens to be the key to understanding just about everything about modern meat. For the grasses, which have evolved to withstand the grazing of ruminants, the cow maintains and expands their habitat by preventing trees and shrubs from gaining a foothold and hogging the sunlight; the animal also spreads grass seed, plants it with his hooves, and then fertilizes it with his manure. In exchange for these services, the grasses offer ruminants a plentiful and exclusive supply of lunch. Cows( like sheep, bison, and other ruminants) have evolved the special ability to convert grass which single-stomached creatures like us can't digest into high-quality protein. They can do this because they possess what is surely the most highly evolved digestive organ in nature: the rumen. About the size of a medicine ball, the organ is essentially a forty-five-gallon fermentation tank in which a resident population of bacteria dines on grass. Living their unseen lives at the far end of the food chain that culminates in a hamburger, these bacteria have, just like the grasses, coevolved with the cow, whom they feed. Truly this is an excellent system for all concerned: for the grasses, for the bacteria, for the animals, and for us, the animals eaters.

10.Songbirds. 鸣禽  

Males do the singing and females do the listening. This has been the established, even cherished view of courtship in birds, but now some ornithologists are changing the tune.
Lszl Garamszegi of the University of Antwerp, Belgium, and colleagues studied the literature on 233 European songbird species. Of the 109 for which information on females was available, they found evidence for singing in 101 species. In only eight species could the team conclude that females did not sing?
Females that sing have been overlooked, the team says, because their songs are quiet, they are mistaken for males from their similar plumage, or they live in less well-studied areas such as the tropics. Garamszegi blames Charles Darwin for the oversight. He emphasized the importance of male sexual display, and this is what everyone has been looking at.
The findings go beyond modern species. After carefully tracing back an evolutionary family tree for their songbirds, the Garamszegis team discovered that, in at least two bird families, singing evolved in females first. They suggest these ancient females may have been using their songs to deter other females from their territories, to coordinate breeding activities with males, or possibly to attract mates.

11.Parent's born order. 父母出生顺序  

Parents own birth order can become an issue when dynamics in the family they are raising replicate the family in which they were raised. Agati notes common examples, such as a firstborn parent getting into"raging battles" with a firstborn child."Both are used to getting the last word. Each has to be right. But the parent has to be the grown-up and step out of that battle," he advises. When youngest children become parents, Agati cautions that because they"may not have had high expectations placed on them, they, in turn, may not see their kids for their abilities."
But he also notes that since youngest children tend to be more social,"youngest parents can be helpful to their firstborn, who may have a harder time with social situations. These parents can help their eldest kids loosen up and not be so hard on themselves. Mom Susan Ritz says her own birth order didn't seem to affect her parenting until the youngest of her three children, Julie, was born. Julie was nine years younger than Ritz's oldest, Joshua, mirroring the age difference between Susan and her own older brother." I would see Joshua do to Julie what my brother did to me," she says of the taunting and teasing by a much older sibling.
"I had to try not to always take Julie's side." Biases can surface no matter what your own birth position was, as Lori Silverstone points out."As a middle myself, I can be harder on my older daughter. I recall my older sister hitting me," she says of her reactions to her daughters tussles.

12.Living in countryside. 乡村生活  

I knew it was a good idea because I had been there before. Born and reared on a farm I had been seduced for a few years by the idea of being a big shot who lived and worked in a city rather than only going for the day to wave at the buses. True, I was familiar with some of the minor disadvantages of country living such as an iffy private water supply sometimes infiltrated by a range of flora and fauna-including, on one memorable occasion, a dead lamb, the absence of central heating in farmhouses and cottages, and a single-track farm road easily blocked by snow, broken-down machinery or escaped livestock.
But there were many advantages as I told Liz back in the mid-Seventies. Town born and bred, eight months pregnant and exchanging a warm, substantial Corstorphine terrace for a windswept farm cottage on a much lower income, persuading her that country had it over town might have been difficult.

13.Napping. 午睡  

Could midday napping save your life?
If the experience of Greek men is any guide, the answer just maybe yes.
In a study released yesterday, researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health and in Athens reported that Greeks who took regular 30 minute siestas were 37 percent less likely to die of heart disease over six year than those who never napped. The scientists tracked more than 23, 000 adults, finding that the benefits of napping were most pronounced for workers.
Researchers have long recognized that Mediterranean adults die of heart disease at a rate lower than Americans and Northern Europeans. Diets rich in olive oil and other heart-healthy foods have received some of the credit, but scientists have been intrigued by the potential role of napping.
The study, published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, concluded that napping was more likely than diet or physical activity to lower the incidence of heart attacks and other life-ending heart ailments.
Still, the authors cautioned that further research is needed to confirm their findings.

14.House mice. 家鼠  

According to new research, house mice( Mus musculus) are ideal biomarkers of human settlement as they tend to stow away in crates or on ships that end up going where people go. Using mice as a proxy for human movement can add to what is already known through archaeological data and answer important questions in areas where there is a lack of artifacts, Searle said.
Where people go, so do mice, often stowing away in carts of hay or on ships. Despite a natural range of just 100 meters( 109 yards) and an evolutionary base near Pakistan, the house mouse has managed to colonize every continent, which makes it a useful tool for researchers like Searle.
Previous research conducted by Searle at the University of York supported the theory that Australian mice originated in the British Isles and probably came over with convicts shipped there to colonize the continent in the late 18th and 19th centuries.
In the Viking study, he and his fellow researchers in Iceland, Denmark and Sweden took it a step further, using ancient mouse DNA collected from archaeological sites dating from the 10th to 12th centuries, as well as modern mice.
He is hoping to do just that in his next project, which involves tracking the migration of mice and other species, including plants, across the Indian Ocean, from South Asia to East Africa.

15.Wine industry in US. 美国葡萄酒产业  

In 1920, the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was enacted, creating yet another serious setback to the American wine industry. The National Prohibition Act, also known as the Volstead Act, prohibited the manufacture, sale, transportation, importation, exportation, delivery, or possession of intoxicating liquors for beverage purposes, and nearly destroyed what had become a thriving national industry. In 1920 there were more than seven hundred wineries in California. By the end of Prohibition, there were 160.
If Prohibition had lasted only four or five years, its impact on the wine industry might have been negligible. But it continued for thirteen years, during which time grapes went underground literally and figuratively, becoming an important commodity in the criminal economy. The fruit juice, which was sometimes made into concentrate, was ideal for making wine. Some of this yield found its way to bootleggers throughout America who did just that. But not for long, because the government stepped in and banned the sale of grape juice, preventing illegal wine production. Vineyards stopped being planted, and the American wine industry ground to a halt.

16.South African. 南非人  

At around 2300 BP( Before Present), hunter-gatherers called the San acquired domestic stock in what is now modern-day Botswana. Their population grew and spread throughout the Western half of South Africa. They were the first pastoralists in southern Africa, and called themselves Khoikhoi( or Khoe), which means men of men or the real people. This name was chosen to show pride in their past and culture. The Khoikhoi brought a new way of life to South Africa and to the San, who were hunter-gatherers as opposed to herders. This led to misunderstandings and subsequent conflict between the two groups.
The Khoikhoi were the first native people to come into contact with the Dutch settlers in the mid 17th century. As the Dutch took over land for farms, the Khoikhoi were dispossessed, exterminated, or enslaved and therefore their numbers dwindled. The Khoikhoi were called the Hottentots by European settlers because the sound of their language was so different from any European language, and they could not pronounce many of the words and sounds.

17.Non-human animals and humans. 非人类动物与人类  

All non-human animals are constrained by the tools that nature has bequeathed them through natural selection. They are not capable of striving towards truth they simply absorb information and behave in ways useful for their survival. The kinds of knowledge they require of the world have been largely pre-selected by evolution. No animal is capable of asking questions or generating problems that are irrelevant to its immediate circumstances or its evolutionarily designed needs. When a beaver builds a dam, it doesn't ask itself why it does so, or whether there is a better way of doing it. When a swallow flies south, it doesn't wonder why it is hotter in Africa or what would happen if it flew still further south.
Humans do ask themselves these and many other kinds of questions, questions that have no relevance and, indeed make little sense, in the context of evolved needs and goals. What marks out humans is our capacity to go beyond our naturally defined goals such as the need to find food, shelter, or a mate, and to establish humanly created goals.
Some contemporary thinkers believe that there are indeed certain questions that humans are incapable of answering because of our evolved nature. Steven Pinker, for instance, argues that"Our minds evolved by natural selection to solve problems that were life and death matters to our ancestors, not to commune with correctness or to answer any question we are capable of asking. We cannot hold ten thousand words in our short-term memory. We cannot see the ultraviolet light. We cannot mentally rotate an object in the fourth dimension. And perhaps we cannot solve conundrums like free will and sentience."

18.US and Indian engineers. 美国和印度工程师  

Considering the current situation like their counterparts in the United States, engineers, and technicians in India have the capacity to provide both computer programming and innovative new technologies. Indian programmers and high-tech engineers earn one-quarter of what their counterparts earn in the United States, Consequently, India is able to do both jobs at a lower dollar cost than the United States India has an absolute advantage in both. In other words, it can produce a unit of programming for fewer dollars than the United States, and it can also produce a unit of technology innovation for fewer dollars. Does that mean that the United States will lose not only programming jobs but innovative technology jobs, too? Does that mean that our standard of living will fall if the United States and India engage in international trade?
David Ricardo would have answered no to both questions as we do today. While India may have an absolute advantage in both activities, that fact is irrelevant in determining what India or the United States will produce. India has a comparative advantage in doing programming in part because such activity requires little physical capital. The flip side is that the United States has a comparative advantage in technology innovation partly because it is relatively easy to obtain capital in this country to undertake such long-run projects. The result is that Indian programmers will do more and more of what U. S. programmers have been doing in the past. In contrast, American firms will shift to more and more innovation.

19.Australian education. 澳大利亚教育  

When Australians engage in debate about educational quality or equity, they often seem to accept that a country cannot achieve both at the same time.
Curriculum reforms intended to improve equity often fail to do so because they increase breadth or differentiation in offerings in a way that increases differences in quality. Further, these differences in quality often reflect differences in student's social backgrounds because the new offerings are typically taken up by relatively disadvantaged students who are not served well them. Evidence from New South Wales will be used to illustrate this point.
The need to improve the quality of education is well accepted across OECD and other countries as they seek to strengthen their human capital to underpin their modern, knowledge economies. Improved equity is also important for this purpose since the demand for high-level skills is widespread and the opportunities for the low skilled are diminishing.
Improved equity in education is also important for social cohesion. There are countries in which the education system seems primarily to reproduce existing social arrangements, conferring privilege where it already exists and denying it where it does not. Even in countries where the diagnosis might be less extreme, the capacity of schooling to build social cohesion is often diminished by the way in which schools separate individuals and groups.

20.Tourism industry. 旅游业  

Jobs generated by Travel Tourism are spread across the economy in retail, construction, manufacturing, and telecommunications, as well as directly in Travel Tourism companies. These jobs employ a large proportion of women, minorities and young people are predominantly small and medium-sized companies and offer good training and transferability. Tourism can also be one of the most effective drivers for the development of regional economies. These patterns apply to both developed and emerging economies.
There are numerous good examples of where Travel Tourism is acting as a catalyst for conservation and improvement of the environment and maintenance of local diversity and culture. Travel Tourism creates jobs and wealth and has tremendous potential to contribute to economically, environmentally and socially sustainable development in both developed countries and emerging nations. It has a comparative advantage in that its start-up and running costs can be low compared to many other forms of industrial development. It is also often one of the few realistic options for development in many areas. Therefore, there is a strong likelihood that the Travel Tourism industry will continue to grow globally over the short to medium term.

21.Aging world. 老龄化世界  

We live in an aging world. While this has been recognized for some time in developed countries, it is only recently that this phenomenon has been fully acknowledged. Global communication is"shrinking" the world, and global aging is"maturing" it. The increasing presence of older persons in the world is making people of all ages more aware that we live in a diverse and multigenerational society. It is no longer possible to ignore aging, regardless of whether one views it positively or negatively.
Demographers note that if current trends in aging continue as predicted, a demographic revolution, wherein the proportions of the young and the old will undergo a historic crossover, will be felt in just three generations. This portrait of change in the world's population parallels the magnitude of the industrial revolution traditionally considered the most significant social and economic breakthrough in the history of humankind since the Neolithic period. It marked the beginning of a sustained movement towards modern economic growth in much the same way that globalization is today marking an unprecedented and sustained movement toward a"global culture". The demographic revolution, it is envisaged, will be at least as powerful.
While the future effects are not known, a likely scenario is one where both the challenges as well as the opportunities will emerge from a vessel into which exploration and research, dialogue and debate are poured. Challenges arise as social and economic structures try to adjust to the simultaneous phenomenon of diminishing young cohorts with rising older ones, and opportunities present themselves in the sheer number of older individuals and the vast resources societies stand to gain from their contribution.

We live in an aging world and it is no longer possible to ignore aging, and the portrait of change in the world 's population parallels the magnitude of the industrial revolution traditionally considered the most significant social, so chances present themselves in the sheer number of older individuals and the huge resources societies stand to gain from their disbursement.

22.Human remains. 人类遗骸  

Human remains are a fundamental part of the archaeological record, offering unique insights into the lives of individuals and populations in the past. Like many archaeological materials, human remains require distinctive and specialized methods of recovery, analysis, and interpretation, while technological innovations and the accumulation of expertise have enabled archaeologists to extract ever greater amounts of information from assemblages of skeletal material. Alongside analyses of new finds, these advances have consistently thrown new light on existing collections of human remains in museums, universities and other institutions. Given the powerful emotional, social and religious meanings attached to the dead body, it is perhaps unsurprising that human remains pose a distinctive set of ethical questions for archaeologists.
With the rise of indigenous rights movements and the emergence of post-colonial nations, the acquisition and ownership of human remains became a divisive and politically loaded issue. It became increasingly clear that many human remains in museum collections around the world represented the traces of colonial exploitation and discredited pseudo-scientific theories of race. In the light of these debates and changing attitudes, some human remains were returned or repatriated to their communities of origin, a process that continues to this day. Recently a new set of challenges to the study of human remains has emerged from a rather unexpected direction: the British government revised its interpretation of nineteenth-century burial legislation in a way that would drastically curtail the ability of archaeologists to study human remains of any age excavated in England and Wales. This paper examines these extraordinary events and the legal, political and ethical questions that they raise.

23.Resonance theory. 共振理论  

The history of marketers seeking the advice of physicists is a short one, but an understanding of the Theory of Resonance may give communications experts the edge. Resonance Theory explains the curious phenomenon of how very small pebbles dropped into a pond can create bigger waves than a large brick. The brick makes a decent splash but its ripples peter out quickly. A tiny pebble dropped into the same pond, followed by another, then another, then another, all timed carefully, will create ripples that build into small waves.
As Dr Carlo Contaldi, a physicist at Imperial College London, explains, a small amount of energy committed at just the right intervals the natural frequency creates a cumulatively large effect. Media consultant Paul Bay believes that just as with pebbles in a pond, a carefully choreographed and meticulously timed stream of communication will have a more lasting effect than a sporadic big splash during prime-time TV breaks. So whether you're trying to make waves in the laboratory or in the media, the people in white coats would advise a little and often. A big budget is not the prerequisite for success.

24.School resource officer. 学校资源官员  

Spurred by the sense that disorderly behavior among students in South Euclid was increasing, the school resource officer( SRO) reviewed data regarding referrals to the principal's office. He found that the high school reported thousands of referrals a year for bullying and that the junior high school had recently experienced a 30 percent increase in bullying referrals. Police data showed that juvenile complaints about disturbances, bullying, and assaults after school hours had increased by 90 percent in the past ten years.
The SRO worked in close collaboration with a social worker and a university researcher. They coordinated a Response Planning Team comprising many stakeholders that were intended to respond to each of the areas identified in the initial analysis. Environmental changes included modifying the school schedule and increasing teacher supervision of hotspots. Counselors and social workers conducted teacher training courses in conflict resolution and bullying prevention. Parent education included mailings with information about bullying, an explanation of the new school policy, and a discussion about what could be done at home to address the problems. Finally, student education included classroom discussions between homeroom teachers and students, as well as assemblies conducted by the SRO. The SRO also opened a substation next to a primary hotspot. The Ohio Department of Education contributed by opening a new training center to provide a non-traditional setting for specialized help.
The results from the various responses were dramatic. School suspensions decreased by 40 percent. Bullying incidents dropped 60 percent in the hallways and 80 percent in the gym area. Follow-up surveys indicated that there were positive attitudinal changes among students about bullying and that more students felt confident that teachers would take action when a problem arose. Teachers indicated that training sessions were helpful and that they were more likely to talk about bullying as a serious issue. Parents responded positively, asking for more information about the problem in future mailings. The overall results suggest that the school environments were not only safer but that early intervention was helping at-risk students succeed in school.

25.Tree ring. 年轮  

Here's how tree-ring dating, known to scientists as dendrochronology works. If you cut a tree down today, it's straightforward to count the rings inwards, starting from the trees outside( corresponding to this year's growth ring), and thereby to state that the 177th ring from the outermost one towards the center was laid down in the year 2005 minus 177, or 1828. But it's less straightforward to attach a date to a particular ring in an ancient Anasazi wooden beam because at first, you don't know in what year the beam was cut. However, the widths of tree growth rings vary from year to year, depending on the rain or drought conditions in each year.
Hence the sequence of the rings in a tree cross-section is like a message in Morse code formerly used for sending telegraph messages dot-dot-dash dot-dash in the Morse code, wide-wide-narrow wide-narrow in the tree ring sequence. Actually, the tree ring sequence is even more diagnostic and richer in information than the Morse code, because trees actually contain rings spanning many different widths, rather than the Morse code choice between dot and dash.
Tree-ring specialists( known as dendrochronologists) proceed by noting the sequence of wider and narrower rings in a tree cut down in a known recent year, and also noting the sequences in beams from trees cut down at various times in the past. They then match up and align the tree ring sequences with the same diagnostic wide, narrow patterns from different beams.
In that way, dendrochronologists have constructed tree-ring records extending back for thousands of years in some parts of the world. Each record is valid for a geographic area whose extent depends on local weather patterns because weather and hence tree growth patterns vary with location. For instance, the basic tree-ring chronology of the American Southwest applies( with some variation) to the area from Northern Mexico to Wyoming.

26.Greenhouse gas. 温室气体  

When an individual drives a car, heats a house or uses an aerosol hairspray, greenhouse gases are produced. In economic terms, this creates a classic negative externality. Most of the cost is borne by individuals other than the one making the decision about how many miles to drive or how much hairspray to use. Because the driver or sprayer enjoys all the benefits of the activities but suffers only part of the cost, that individual engages in more than the economically efficient amount of the activity. In this sense, the problem of greenhouse gases parallels the problem that occurs when someone smokes a cigarette in an enclosed space or litters the countryside with fast-food wrappers. If we are to get individuals to reduce the production of greenhouse gases to an efficient rate, we must somehow induce them to act as though they bear all the costs of their actions. The two most widely accepted means of doing this are government regulation and taxation, both of which have been proposed to deal with greenhouse gases.

27.Written language. 书面语言  

The world engages in improving the literacy of reading and writing, but it is not that important now. What is a text-written language anyway? It is an accident IT for storing and retrieving information. We store information by writing it, and we retrieve it by reading it. 6000 to 10, 000 years ago, many of our ancestor's hunter-gatherer societies settled on the land and began what's known as the agricultural revolution. That new land settlement led to private property and increased production and trade of goods, generating a huge new influx of information. Unable to keep all this in their memories, our ancestors created systems of written records that evolved over millennia into today's written language. But this ancient IT is already becoming obsolete. The text has run its historical course and is now rapidly getting replaced in every area of our lives by the ever-increasing emerging IT driven by voice, video, and body movement rather than the written word. In my view, this is a positive step forward in the evolution of human technology, and it carries great potential for a total positive redesign of education. Written language is an ancient IT for storing and retrieving information. However, the written word is becoming obsolete and is now rapidly getting replaced by voice, video and body movement, which is believed a positive step forward in the evolution of human technology and redesign of education.

28.Office environment. 办公环境  

The notion that office space has a role in promoting or inhibiting performance is backed up by solid research. A recent study conducted by Harvard University and Massachusetts General Hospital showed that improvements to the physical surroundings of workers impacted productivity not just because the working environment was more attractive, but because the changes made employees feel cared for. A Swedish research paper revealed a strong link between the type of office an employee worked in and their overall job satisfaction and health.
Various findings have emerged as a result of studies such as this. Pot plants and greenery can apparently have a real impact on psychological well-being. Those who work in a private room tend to be in better health than workers based in open-plan offices. Sufficient light can reduce sickness among workers and increase productivity, and an attractive office can make workers feel more cared for and therefore more loyal to their company.
Most of these points make good rational sense. But some companies aren't content simply to increase the health, productivity, and contentment of their employees. Pioneers such as Google, Walt Disney, and Dyson have tried to create offices that will do everything from promoting collaboration between workers to stimulating their creative juices.
"Environment, both physical and cultural, can make or break creativity", says Kursty Groves, author of I Wish I Worked There! A look inside the most creative spaces in business. Stimulating spaces expose the mind to a variety of stimuli, planned or random. In order to encourage people to think differently. Reflective spaces promote the filtering of information into the brain slowing it to make connections. An environment that encourages a team to build trust and to play freely is an essential ingredient for innovation.

29.The Wright brothers. 莱特兄弟  

Orville and Wilbur Wright were brothers living in Dayton, Ohio. The two had started making bicycles during the 1890s and had a successful small business selling their Wright Specials for 18 each( 475 in today's green). This experience with building light, strong machines would prove valuable in the coming years after the brothers interest turned to flight. Others in the United States were also developing aircraft at the time the Wright brothers started turning their curiosity skyward. Samuel Langley had flown an unmanned steam-powered aircraft in 1896. Octave Chanute and others were flying gliders near Chicago late in the decade as well. But it wasn't until the Wright brothers started working on the matter that the flying problem would finally be solved. Beginning in 1899, the brothers designed and built a series of gliders to test their various ideas on a flying machine. They constructed a wind tunnel that allowed them to test designs without having to build a full-size model. They even built their own gasoline-powered motor for their aircraft.

30.Australian indigenous food. 澳大利亚土著食物  

In its periodic quest for culinary identity, Australia automatically looks to its indigenous ingredients, the foods that are native to this country. There can be little doubt that using an indigenous product must qualify a dish as Australian notes, Stephanie Alexander. Similarly, and without qualification, states that a uniquely Australian food culture can only be based on foods indigenous to this country, although, as Craw remarks, proposing Australian native foods as national symbols relies more upon their association with nature and geographic origin than on common usage Notwithstanding the lack of justification for the premise that national dishes are, of necessity, founded on ingredients native to the country. After all, Italy's gastronomic identity is tied to the non-indigenous tomato, Thailand then indigenous chili, and the reality is that Australians do not eat indigenous foods in significant quantities. The exceptions are fish, crustaceans, and shellfish from oceans, rivers, and lakes, most of which are unarguably unique to this country. Despite valiant and well-intentioned efforts today at promoting and encouraging the consumption of native resources, bush foods are not harvested or produced in sufficient quantities for them to be a standard component of Australian diets, nor are they generally accessible. Indigenous foods are less relevant to Australian identity today than lamb and passionfruit, both initially imported and now naturalized.

31.Plants Research. 植物研究  

Plants serve as the conduit of energy into the biosphere, provide food and materials used by humans, and they shape our environment. According to Ehrhardt and Frommer, the three major challenges facing humanity in our time are food, energy, and environmental degradation. All three are plant related.
All of our food is produced by plants, either directly or indirectly via animals that eat them. Plants are a source of energy production. And they are intimately involved in climate change and a major factor in a variety of environmental concerns, including agricultural expansion and its impact on habitat destruction and waterway pollution.
What s more, none of these issues are independent of each other. Climate change places additional stresses on the food supply and various habitats. So, plant research is instrumental in addressing all of these problems and moving into the future. For plant research to move significantly forward, Ehrhardt and Former say technological development is critical, both to test existing hypotheses and to gain new information and generate fresh hypotheses. If we are to make headway in understanding how these essential organisms function and build the foundation for a sustainable future, then we need to apply the most advanced technologies available to the study of plant life, they say.

32.Sochi Olympic Games. 索契奥运会  

Major athletic events around the globe from the 2014 Sochi Olympics to an annual powerboat race in Norwegian fjords are striving to neutralize their carbon footprint as part of a worldwide climate network, the United Nations Environment Programme( UNEP) said today.
The sporting events are the latest participants to join the network, and are particularly important for inspiring further global action on the environment, said Achim Steiner, UNEP Executive Director.
Organizers of the 2014 Sochi Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games to be held in a unique natural setting between the shores of the Black Sea and the soaring snow-capped Caucasus Mountains say they will put an estimated 1. 75 billion into energy conservation and renewable energy.
That investment will be dedicated to improving transport infrastructure, offsetting greenhouse gas emissions from the use of electricity, air travel and ground transportation, the reforestation of Sochi National Park and the development of green belts in the city.

33.Writing. 写作  

It might seem a little eccentric, but reviewing your work by reading it aloud can help to identify the woolliest areas. This works best if you perform your reading in a theatrical way, pausing at the commas and ends of sentences. If you run out of breath during a sentence, it is probably too long. You ought to be able to convert your writing into a speech in this way if it sounds too stilted and convoluted, perhaps you could rework these parts until they sound fluid.
It is unlikely that your reader will be fooled by the idea that long words make you sound clever. Cluttering a sentence with too many complicated words can prevent its meaning from being understood at all. A short word is always preferable to a long one. Why should anyone choose the word erroneous over the word wrong in an essay? Usually, writers who employ more obscure words are trying to sound impressive but can appear pretentious. Direct words enable you to control what you are saying and are not necessarily babyish, but the most appropriate ones for the job.
When you read your writing aloud, you will notice that the key stress comes at the end of your sentence. It is, therefore, most effective to end with a short and emphatic word to secure your point. Try to resist the impulse to waffle at the end of your sentence by trailing off into qualifying clauses. It might be worth relocating the clause to the beginning of the sentence or losing it altogether if you feel that it adds little to its meaning.
Your sentences might be the most grammatically perfect in the world, but they still, cause your writing to sound wrong if you have misjudged its tone. A colloquial style, which uses slang and exclamations, is an inappropriately chatty tone for an essay. However, style can be equally jarring if your vocabulary is too formal or ambitious for its context. It is much more impressive to make complicated points using simple language and grammar.

36.Primary Carer. 主要照顾者  

Slightly less than one in five carers( 19) were primary carers( 475, 000 people). That is, they were the main carer of a person who was limited in carrying out the core everyday activities of mobility, communication or self-care. Both primary carers and the larger group of other carers( close to 2 million) contribute to the well-being of older people and people with disabilities. However, because they care for people who otherwise would have difficulty carrying out basic everyday activities, there is particular interest in primary carers: in the contribution they make, their well-being, labor force experiences, motivations and the support they receive in caring.
Primary carers were more likely than other carers to be assisting someone who lived in the same household( 81 compared with 76). As with caring as a whole, the likelihood of being in primary care increased with age to peak at age 55 64 years, where one in twenty people were primary carers. However, rather than then declining, the likelihood of being a primary carer remained at around this level among the older age groups. Consequently, primary carers had a somewhat older age profile than other carers. The median age of primary carers was 52 years, compared with 47 years for other carers.
Primary carers were more likely than other carers to be female( 71 compared with 50) and less likely to be in the labor force( 39 compared with 60). Women not in the labor force were by far the largest single group among primary carers( 44). In contrast, men employed full-time were the largest single group among other carers( 25). Consistent with their lower labor force participation, primary carers had lower personal incomes than other carers( a median gross income of 237 per week compared with 327 per week) and were more likely to have a government pension or allowance as their main source of income( 55 compared with 35).

37.RAS (Royal Agricultural Society). 皇家农业协会  

The evolution of the RAS( Royal Agricultural Society) fits into the broader Western trend of promoting nationalism, progress, and technology through exhibitory venues, which first became popular in the 1850s. Various types of fairs, from local agricultural shows to Worlds Fairs, were used as instruments of hegemony to support imperialism, promote burgeoning capitalist endeavors, and shape class identities, social spaces and public spaces Visual culture and the art of display became essential in defining aspects of national distinction. Colonial nations in particular, such as Canada and Australia, were attempting to develop distinct national identities to differentiate themselves from British imperial power. Agricultural fairs in North America originated at the beginning of the nineteenth century and were devoted to educating practicing framers in ways of improving their cultivation of livestock and crops through the use of various technologies.
Symbolically, this cultivation was linked to the colonial project of civilizing wilderness frontiers. By the mid-twentieth century, advertisements in various forms were common and included programs or brochures, which were handed out to fair-goers as they entered. These were seen as opportunities for educating the public. Often comments promoting the importance of the fair were based on ideas about patriotism and nationalism. The Royal Easter Show is a good example of an exhibitory context that grew from a small fair, based on local agricultural competition, to a larger venue that incorporated the mandates of national development and the cultivation of colonial character.
In 1822, the RAS was created on the premise that there was a dire need in Australia for the development of improved farming skills to better support growing urban populations and export markets. Organizations based on agricultural improvement which played an integral part in converting and organizing land for colonial purposes.

38.Double blind. 双盲  

The feature of being double-blind, where neither patients nor physicians are aware of who receives the experimental treatment, is almost universally trumpeted as being a virtue of clinical trials. Hence, trials that fail to remain successfully double blind are regarded as providing inferior evidential support. The rationale for this view is unobjectionable: doubleb-linding rules out the potentially confounding influences of patient and physician beliefs.
Nonetheless, viewing the double-blind trial as necessarily superior is problematic. For one, it leads to the paradox that very effective experimental treatments will not be supportable by the best evidence. If a new drug were to make even the most severe symptoms of the common cold disappear within seconds, most participants and investigators would correctly identify it as the latest wonder drug and not the control( i. e. placebo) treatment. Any trial testing the effectiveness of this wonder drug will, therefore, fail to remain double-blind. Similar problems arise for treatments, such as exercise and most surgical techniques, whose nature makes them resistant to being tested in double-blind conditions. It seems strange that an account of evidence should make prior judgments that certain claims can never be supported by the best evidence. It would be different if the claims at issue were pseudo-scientific untestable. But so far as treatments with large effects go, the claim that they are effective is highly testable, and intuitively they should receive greater support from the evidence than do claims about treatments with moderate effects.

40.Population. 人口  

In 2005, Japan had the highest median age of all countries in the world, while Australia's population was only moderately aged. Some 50 years ago the demographic situation was quite different, with the median age of Australia's population being seven years older than Japan's.
The aging of the population is a major issue for Australian policymakers, particularly in regard to the long-term implications for reduced economic growth and the increasing demand for Age Pensions, and health and aged care services. As the population ages, growth in the number of people of working age will slow, while the proportion of people of retirement age will increase.
Sustained population aging also leads to slowing or negative population growth. While declining population growth in developed countries is welcomed by some environmentalists and social scientists, economists tend to agree that population decline brings gloomy economic prospects. In addition to the decrease in the labor supply, the demand side of the economy may be affected by shrinking markets for goods and services.
How quickly this occurs depends on the dynamics of fertility, mortality and overseas migration. While a moderate pace of demographic change allows for gradual adjustment of the economy and policies to the changing population demographics, rapid changes are more difficult to manage. As a result, governments and society as a whole may need to take action to address these issues. But how severe is the aging of Australia's population, relative to other countries?

The ageing of the population is a major issue for Australian policy makers, and sustained population ageing also leads to negative population growth, and how quickly this occurs depends on the dynamics of fertility, mortality and overseas migration, and this article examines the population structures in Australia and Japan and the demographic forces that shape the respective populations, both historically and projections for the future.

She will be the only British scientist in the team to study the Greenland shark, which is believed to be the vertebrate animal and mammal with the longest-living. The shark is reported to have lived for more than 200 years, and possibly close to or more than 400 years. The shark is both a hunter and a scavenger, that feeds on seals and other animals including polar bears and whales. It is also known as one of the largest sharks, reaching to five and a half meters( 18 feet), very close to the size of a great white. The research team is commissioned by the Greenland government and will conduct the research on board the multi-purpose research vessel Sanna, operated by the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources. A Greenland shark is estimated to be able to live for 400 years according to Science Magazine. Professor Shiels expects to gather sufficient data on the Greenland shark, a top predator in the Arctic sea. She wanted to find a clue of how Greenland shark is able to survive in the deep sea of the Arctic Sea, by examining how its heart and circulation work in its normal habitat, as she specializes in cardiovascular function."Greenland sharks are classified as data deficient," Shiels said."This means that we don't know enough to put measures in place to protect them from over-fishing, pollution or climate change."

127.Brain. 大脑  

It's important to realize that the brain doesn't see the world around it simply as though the scene was projected onto a cinema screen on the inside of your skull. Before a scene can be observed in your head it has to be broken down into a number of different components for processing, and these components then have to be recombined into the meaningful form that we call an image. Amongst other things, the scene is broken down into its different colours red, green and blue in a way that's analogous to the manner in which a television image or magazine photograph is broken down into tiny dots of primary colors( which are too small to be noticed individually when we look at them, but which when seen collectively give the impression of a continuous full-colour image). However, unlike TV and magazine images, the image that we see with our eyes is broken down not only into separate color components but into other components too. It is, rather incredibly, deconstructed into component parts such as horizontal lines, vertical lines, circles and so on. Each of these component parts is sent to a separate area of the brain for processing, with the different components of the scene only merging again when they are unified into what you perceive as the image.

128.Skip breakfast V2. 不吃早餐 第二版  

Skipping Breakfast Has Drawbacks It's no mystery why so many people routinely skip breakfast: bad timing. It comes at a time when folks can be more occupied with matters of grooming, attire and otherwise making themselves presentable for a new day. However, studies conducted both in the United States and internationally have shown that skipping breakfast can affect learning, memory and physical well-being. Students who skip breakfast are not as efficient at selecting critical information for problem-solving as their peers who have had breakfast. For schoolchildren, skipping breakfast diminishes the ability to recall and use newly acquired information, verbal fluency, and control of attention, according to Ernesto Pollitt, a UC Davis professor of pediatrics whose research focuses on the influence of breakfast on mental and physical performance. Skipping breakfast can impair thinking in adults, also. For both children and adults, a simple bowl of cereal with milk goes a long way toward providing a sufficiently nutritious start to the day. Green-Burgeson recommends choosing a cereal that's low in sugar less than five grams per serving and using nonfat or one percent milk. Frederick Hirshburg, a pediatrician at UC Davis Medical Group, Carmichael, says that babies and other preschoolers rarely skip breakfast because they're usually the hungriest at the beginning of the day. Breakfast then becomes more of a"learned experience" than a response to a biological need, Hirshburg says.

135.Bertrand Russell. 伯特兰·罗素  

Philosophers typically classify Russell not only as an analytic philosopher but as one of the founders of analytic philosophy and
for good reasons, for one thing he always insisted upon was that his method of philosophizing (and the one others should follow) was
the method of analysis. This method of analysis is a version of the older version of the method of analysis-synthesis.
The methof of analysis consists of two steps: first analyzing a phenomenon into its basic parts, and secondly synthesizing or re-constructing this original phenomenon. In the method of analysis one begins with something as a daturn, e.g., the existence of scientific knowledge , and proceeds to infer the conditions making it possible. This reference occurs by means of analysis, which was traditinally thought to be the task of philosophy. The synthetic method, on the other hand, proceeds from these conditions to（deductively）inferring the original datum; this is the hallmark of the mathematical sciences. (In some places, however, Russel contrasts philosophy and mathematics, whereas in still other places he claims that philosophy subsums both methods.)
Russell employed this twofold method in the early decades of the twentieth century, attempting to reduce mathematics to logic or show how mathematics could be constructed from logic(plus set theory). Russell applied this same technique to several other problems—the problem of reference or denotation –then to the problem of our knowledge of the external world. It is this latter problem, of showing how, beginning from one’s initial sensory experience, it is possible to ‘construct ‘ our scientific knowledge of the world, that marks the decisive move of Russell’s towards a more naturalistic interpretation of epistemology.

136.Solar energy. 太阳能  

The advantages and disadvantages of solar power compared to other forms of renewable energy have been greatly debated. While obviously superior to some forms of energy, solar power's high cost and efficiency dependent on geography have limited its appeal. However, a large number of advantages also merit further development and even possible adaptation for residences.
Advantages of Solar Power
Solar energy remains popular because it is both a renewable and clean source of energy. These advantages along with the hope that eventually, nations can use solar power to decrease global warming ensure its popularity.
Renewable
Solar energy is a true renewable resource. All areas of the world have the ability to collect some amount of solar power and solar power is available for collection each day.
Clean
Solar energy is non-polluting. It does not create greenhouse gases, such as oil-based energy does, nor does it create waste that must be stored, such as nuclear energy. It is also far quieter to create and harness, drastically reducing the noise pollution required to convert energy to a useful form. Residential size solar energy systems also have very little impact on the surrounding environment, in contrast with other renewable energy sources such as wind and hydroelectric power.
Low Maintenance
Solar panels have no moving parts and require very little maintenance beyond regular cleaning. Without moving parts to break and replace, after the initial costs of installing the panels, maintenance and repair costs are very reasonable.

138.Education technology. 教育技术  

IN 1953 B. F. Skinner visited his daughter's maths class. The Harvard psychologist found every pupil learning the same topic in the same way at the same speed. A few days later he built his first"teaching machine", which let children tackle questions at their own pace. By the mid 1960s similar gizmos were being flogged by door-to door salesmen. Within a few years, though, enthusiasm for them had fizzled out.
Since then education technology( edtech) has repeated the cycle of hype and flop, even as computers have reshaped almost every other part of life. One reason is the conservatism of teachers and their unions. But another is that the brain-stretching potential of edtech has remained unproven.
Today, however, Skinner's heirs are forcing the sceptics to think again( see article). Backed by billionaire techies such as Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates, schools around the world are using new software to"personalize" learning. This could help hundreds of millions of children stuck in dismal classes but only if edtech boosters can resist the temptation to revive harmful ideas about how children learn. To succeed, edtech must be at the service of teaching, not the other way around.
The conventional model of schooling emerged in Prussia in the 18th century. Alternatives have so far failed to teach as many children as efficiently. Classrooms, hierarchical year-groups, standardized curriculums and fixed timetables are still the norm for most of the world's nearly 1. 5bn schoolchildren.

139.Two ways of learning language. 语言学习的两种方式  

"Over the years, language teachers have alternated between favoring teaching approaches that focus primarily on language use and those that focus on language forms or analysis. The alternation has been due to a fundamental disagreement concerning whether one learns to communicate in a second language by communicating in that language( such as in an immersion experience) or whether one learns to communicate in a second language by learning the lexicogrammar the words and grammatical structures of the target language. In other words, the argument has been about two different means of achieving the same end."
As with any enduring controversy, the matter is not easily resolved. For one thing, there is evidence to support both points of view. It is not uncommon to find learners who, for whatever reason, find themselves in a new country or a new region of their own country, who need to learn a new language, and who do so without the benefit of formal instruction. If they are postpubescent, they may well retain an accent of some kind, but they can pick up enough language to satisfy their communicative needs. In fact, some are natural acquirers who become highly proficient in this manner. In contrast, there are learners whose entire exposure to the new language comes in the form of classroom instruction in lexicogrammar. Yet they too achieve a measure of communicative proficiency, and certain of these learners become highly proficient as well. What we can infer from this is that humans are amazingly versatile learners and that some people have a natural aptitude for acquiring languages and will succeed no matter what the circumstances.

140.Three types of authority. 三种权威类型  

All three forms exhibit a specific weakness or problem.
First, charismatic leadership can be problematic because it is somehow based on some form of a messianic promise of overhauling an unjust system. It is not impossible, however, to find such type of a leader, as history would show. Consider Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., or Nelson Mandela. A charismatic leader holds the mission to unite his people amid adversity and differences in order to attain an almost insurmountable goal.
Second, traditional authority poses its particular difficulty insofar as it is based on some kind of a dominant power. For Weber, all authority exhibits some form of domination. A traditional leader may rely on or even exploit prevailing practices. Traditional authority may suffer from a lack of moral regularity in the creation of legal standards.
Third, legal-rational authority makes manifest the power of the bureaucracy over the individual. In the exercise of authority, the administration of power, laws and rules, including institutional duties and protocols, have control over individuals. While order and systematization are desirable, the bureaucracy may not be able to fully address the problems and concerns of everyone, as what the development of nation-states today suggests.
Modern societies rely on legal-rational authority in terms of finding a common ground in which consensus may be achieved. But consensus on the basis of agreements often lacks flexibility, which may embody the dominance of a bureaucratic mentality of which government service is sometimes accused.

141.Humans love to complain. 人类爱抱怨  

Humans love to complain to each other. It helps us feel less alone. Think about what happens when a family member or friend is going through a tough time; they call up someone who will listen to their tale of woe. Unfortunately, negative bonding is the default for many groups.
In some families complaining is the only way to get attention. When one person says, I had a bad day; the other person has to top it."You think you had a tough day, I had to do three TPS reports!" The same thing happens at work and in social settings."Your child didn't sleep through the night until 6 months? Mine was a full year old before she went over six hours." It's a race to the bottom, the worst situation wins.
In Bitching is Bonding, A Guide To Mutual Complaint, Irene S. Levine, Ph. D., a professor of psychiatry at the NYU Langone School of Medicine says,"The reason these conversations feel good is that we feel understood."
People raised in negative environments learn early on, that being positive gets you thrown out of the club. When family dinner is a complaint fest, you're not going to risk alienation by saying,"Wow, I had an awesome day, don't you just love life?"
Translate this into a work setting, people, often unconsciously, believe being positive keeps you out of the cool club. When negativity provides bonding, humans are reluctant to abandon the behavior that brings them comfort.

143.Independent work. 独立工作  

Working nine to five for a single employer bears little resemblance to the way a substantial share of the workforce makes a living today. Millions of people assemble various income streams and work independently, rather than in structured payroll jobs. This is hardly a new phenomenon, yet it has never been well measured in official statistics and the resulting data gaps prevent a clear view of a large share of labor-market activity.
To better understand the independent workforce and what motivates the people who participate in it, the McKinsey Global Institute surveyed some 8, 000 respondents across Europe and the United States. We asked about their income in the past 12 months encompassing primary work, as well as any other income-generating activities and about their professional satisfaction and aspirations for work in the future.
The resulting report, Independent Work: Choice, necessity, and the gig economy, finds that up to 162 million people in Europe and the United States or 20 to 30 percent of the working-age population engage in some form of independent work. While demographically diverse, independent workers largely fit into four segments( exhibit): free agents, who actively choose independent work and derive their primary income from it; casual earners, who use independent work for supplemental income and do so by choice; reluctant, who make their primary living from independent work but would prefer traditional jobs; and the financially strapped, who do supplemental independent work out of necessity.

144.Tax on meat. 肉类税  

A day would come, Percy Shelley predicted in 1813, when"the monopolizing eater of animal flesh would no longer destroy his constitution by eating an acre at a meal". He explained:"The quantity of nutritious vegetable matter consumed in fattening the carcass of an ox would afford 10 times the sustenance if gathered immediately from the bosom of the earth." Two hundred years later, mainstream agronomists and dietitians have caught up with the poet. A growing scientific consensus agrees that feeding cereals and beans to animals is an inefficient and extravagant way to produce human food, that there is a limited amount of grazing land, and that the world will be hard-pressed to supply a predicted population of 9 billion people with a diet as rich in meat as the industrialized world currently enjoys, and that it's not a very healthy diet anyway. On top of this, livestock contribute significantly towards global warming, generating 14. 5 of all manmade greenhouse gas emissions, according to one much-quoted estimate from the United Nations. Now that the problem has been identified, the challenge is to persuade people in wealthy countries to eat less meat. That might seem a tall order, but governments have successfully persuaded people to quit smoking through a combination of public information, regulation and taxation.

145.The National Oceanography Center. 国家海洋学中心  

The National Oceanography Center( NOC) is engaged in research into the potential risks and benefits of exploiting deep-sea mineral resources, some of which are essential for low-carbon technology, as well as using ocean robots to estimate the environmental impact of these potential deep-sea mining activities.
Late last year the NOC led an expedition on the RRS James Cook that found enough of the scarce element Tellurium present in the crust of a submerged volcano that, if it were all to be used in the production of solar PV panels, could provide two-thirds of the UK's annual electricity supply. Recently, the NOC also led an international study demonstrating deep-sea nodule mining will cause long-lasting damage to deep-sea life, lasting at least for decades.
These nodules are potato-sized rocks containing high levels of metals, including copper, manganese and nickel. They grow very slowly on the sea-bed, over millions of years. Although no commercial operations exist to extract these resources, many are planned.
Professor Edward Hill, Executive Director at the NOC commented,"By 2050 there will be nine billion people on earth and attention is increasingly turning to the ocean, particularly the deep ocean, for food, clean supplies of energy and strategic minerals. The NOC is undertaking research related to many aspects and perspectives involved in exploiting ocean resources. This research is aimed at informing with sound scientific evidence the decisions that will need to be taken in the future, as people increasingly turn to the oceans to address some of society's greatest challenges."

146.Positive mind-set. 积极心态  

Research shows that when people work with a positive mindset, performance on nearly every level productivity, creativity, engagement improves. Yet happiness is perhaps the most misunderstood driver of performance. For one, most people believe that success precedes happiness. Once I get a promotion, I'll be happy, they think. Or, Once I hit my sales target, I'll feel great. But because success is a moving target as soon as you hit your target, you raise it again the happiness that results from success is fleeting.
In fact, it works the other way around: People who cultivate a positive mindset perform better in the face of challenges. I call this the happiness advantage every business outcome shows improvement when the brain is positive. I've observed this effect in my role as a researcher and lecturer in 48 countries on the connection between employee happiness and success. And I'm not alone: In a meta-analysis of 225 academic studies, researchers Sonja Lyubomirsky, Laura King, and Ed Diener found strong evidence of directional causality between life satisfaction and successful business outcomes.
Another common misconception is that our genetics, our environment, or a combination of the two determines how happy we are. To be sure, both factors have an impact. But one's general sense of well-being is surprisingly malleable. The habits you cultivate, the way you interact with coworkers, how you think about stress all these can be managed to increase your happiness and your chances of success.

147.Ethics. 伦理学  

Ethics is a set of moral obligations that define right and wrong in our practices and decisions. Many professions have a formalized system of ethical practices that help guide professionals in the field. For example, doctors commonly take the Hippocratic Oath, which, among other things, states that doctors"do no harm" to their patients. Engineers follow an ethical guide that states that they"hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public." Within these professions, as well as within science, the principles become so ingrained that practitioners rarely have to think about adhering to ethics it's part of the way they practice. A breach of ethics is considered very serious, punishable at least within the profession( by revocation of a license, for example), and sometimes by the law as well. Scientific ethics calls for honesty and integrity in all stages of scientific practice, from reporting results regardless to properly attributing collaborators. This system of ethics guides the practice of science, from data collection to publication and beyond. As in other professions, the scientific ethic is deeply integrated into the way scientists work, and they are aware that the reliability of their work and scientific knowledge in general depends upon adhering to that ethic. Many of the ethical principles in science relate to the production of unbiased scientific knowledge, which is critical when others try to build upon or extend research findings. The open publication of data, peer review, replication, and collaboration required by scientific ethics all help to keep science moving forward by validating research findings and confirming or raising questions about results.

150.Biology and climatology. 生物学与气候学  

Ecology is the study of interactions of organisms among themselves and with their environment. It seeks to understand patterns in nature( e. g., the spatial and temporal distribution of organisms) and the processes governing those patterns. Climatology is the study of the physical state of the atmosphere its instantaneous state or weather, its seasonal-to-interannual variability, its long-term average condition or climate, and how climate changes over time. These two fields of scientific study are distinctly different. Ecology is a discipline within the biological sciences and has at its core the principle of natural selection. Climatology is a discipline within the geophysical sciences based on applied physics and fluid dynamics. Both, however, share a common history.
The origin of these sciences is attributed to Aristotle and Theophrastus and their books Meteorological and Enquiry into Plants, respectively, but their modern beginnings trace back to natural history and plant geography. Seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth-century naturalists and geographers saw changes in vegetation as they explored new regions and laid the foundation for the development of ecology and climatology as they sought explanations for these geographic patterns. Alexander von Humboldt, in the early 1800s, observed that widely separated regions have structurally and functionally similar vegetation if their climates are similar. Alphonse de Candolle hypothesized that latitudinal zones of tropical, temperate, and arctic vegetation are caused by temperature and in 1874 proposed formal vegetation zones with associated temperature limits.

152.Public speaking. 公开演讲  

Many insecurities, fears, and doubts stem from a lack of understanding or lack of knowledge about something. The more you understand and know about a situation, the more comfortable you will be and thus the less power your shyness will have over you.
Let's take for example the subject of public speaking. This is an activity that terrifies most people half to death, but only because most people don't have much knowledge about it. If you do some research and investigation, you'll come to learn that it's perfectly natural to be terrified of public speaking and that almost every single person has the same fears and insecurities that you do.
When you take it further and ask yourself why you are so terrified of this, you'll come to learn that you are scared of being judged, or of being laughed at. From there, you can go and read and learn about people who are good at public speaking learn their tips and strategies.
This way you are much more prepared because your knowledge on the subject is vast. As a result of this, your confidence will already be much higher than before, which might allow you to attempt public speaking when you join a club like Toastmasters. As you practice more, you will naturally become even more confident.
This rule applies to any area where you feel insecure. Read and research as much about the topic as possible. This will help increase your confidence enough to give the activity a try to see if you might be able to become better at it. And that initial confidence to take action is all you need to get the ball rolling and overcome your shyness.

155.A new studying mode. 新的学习模式  

Progress was not entirely smooth. The South Sea Bubble burst in 1720 and the coffee house exchanges burned down in 1748. As late as Big Bang in 1986, when bowler hats were finally hung up, you wouldn't have betthe farm on London surpassing New York, Frankfurt and Tokyo as Mammon's international nexus. Yet the 325,000 souls who operate in the UK capital's financial hub have now overtaken their New York rivals in size of the funds managed (including offshore business); they hold 70% of the global secondary bond market and the City dominates foreign exchange trading. And its institutions paid out billion in bonuses in December. The Square Mile has now spread both eastwards from EC3 to Canary Wharf and westwards into Mayfair, where many of the private-equity 'locusts' and their hedge-fund pals now hang out. For foreigners in finance, London is the place to be. It has no Sarbanes-Oxley and no euro to hold it back, yet the fact that it still flies so high is against the odds. London is one of the most expensive cities in the world to live in, transport systems groan and there's an ever-present threat of terrorist attack. But, for the time being, the deals just keep on getting bigger.

156.Carbon-neutral. 碳中和  

You used to think that being green was a luxury for your company, but climate change has made you realize that you can no longer ignore it. The buzz is about becoming carbon-neutral, but where do you start? Consider your drivers. Do you want to become carbon-neutral for marketing reasons, for financial reasons or to help save the planet? Simon Armitage of the Carbon Neutral Company believes:"Your drivers will help you tailor your carbon-reduction program and determine key performance indicators." This will help build a case for going carbon-neutral. First, measure your carbon footprint, or get a specialist to do it for you. That primarily means taking account of your energy usage and emissions caused by travel. Before you begin, think about whether you're collecting the right data and whether it's readily accessible. When implementing any energy reduction measures, ensure you engage with your staff."It's much better if your people decide for themselves when it's sensible for them to travel," says Armitage. You'll also need them to participate in switching off the lights and other energy-saving measures. Set targets and show it's not a one-off exercise.

157.Plant research. 植物研究  

Plants serve as the conduit of energy into the biosphere, provide food and materials used by humans, and they shape our environment. According to Ehrhardt and Frommer, the three major challenges facing humanity in our time are food, energy, and environmental degradation. All three are plant related. 
All of our food is produced by plants, either directly or indirectly via animals that eat them. Plants are a source of energy production. And they are intimately involved in climate change and a major factor in a variety of environmental concerns, including agricultural expansion and its impact on habitat destruction and waterway pollution. 
What’s more, none of these issues are independent of each other. Climate change places additional stresses on the food supply and on various habitats. So, plant research is instrumental in addressing all of these problems and moving into the future. For plant research to move significantly forward, Ehrhardt and Former say technological development is critical, both to test existing hypotheses and to gain new information and generate fresh hypotheses. If we are to make headway in understanding how these essential organisms function and build the foundation for a sustainable future, then we need to apply the most advanced technologies available to the study of plant life, they say.

158.Volunteer program. 志愿者计划  

If you are inspired to take concrete action for global peace and development, take a look at the United Nations Volunteers( UNV) program. Every year, up to 8, 000 qualified and experienced women and men of some 160 different nationalities volunteer for at least six months of their lives to help others. These UN Volunteers work in some 130 countries promoting peace, responding to disasters, empowering communities and helping to build sustainable livelihoods and lasting development. UN Volunteers come from dozens of professional backgrounds but all of them are catalysts of positive change. They are encouraged to be creative and entrepreneurial, and foster volunteerism for peace and development both within and beyond their assignments. They work at the heart of communities in partnership with governments, United Nations entities and civil society. Being a UN Volunteer is not a career( you are currently limited to four years of service), but it is rich with opportunities and experience and offers huge personal rewards. As a UN Volunteer, you receive a Volunteer Living Allowance( VLA) which covers basic needs, housing and utilities. Additionally, UNV will provide a settling-in-grant, life, health, and permanent disability insurance, return airfares and a nominal resettlement allowance.

If you are inspired to take concrete action for global peace and development, take a look at the United Nations Volunteers program; they are encouraged to be creative and entrepreneurial, and foster volunteerism for peace and development both within and beyond their assignments; being a UN Volunteer is not a career, but it is rich with opportunities and experience and offers huge personal rewards.

159.Geothermal. 地热  

What is the solution for nations with increasing energy demands, hindered by frequent power cuts and an inability to compete in the international oil market? For East Africa at least, experts think geothermal energy is the answer. More promising still, the Kenyan government and international investors seem to be listening. This is just in time according to many, as claims of an acute energy crisis are afoot due to high oil prices, population spikes and droughts. 
Geothermal energy works by pumping water into bedrock, where it is heated and returns to the surface as steam which is used directly as a heat source or to drive electricity production. Source: Energy Information Administration, Geothermal Energy in the Western United States and Hawaii. 
Currently over 60% of Kenya’s power comes from hydroelectric sources but these are proving increasingly unreliable as the issue of seasonal variation is intensified by erratic rain patterns. Alternative energy sources are needed; and the leading energy supplier in Kenya, Kenya Electricity Generating Company (KenGen), hopes to expand its geothermal energy supply from 13% to 25 % of its total usage by 2020. The potential of geothermal energy in the region was first realised internationally by the United Nations Development Program, when geologists observed thermal anomalies below the East African Rift system. Locals have been utilising this resource for centuries; using steam vents to create the perfect humidity for greenhouses, or simply to enjoy a swim in the many natural hot lakes. 
Along the 6000 km of the rift from the Red Sea to Mozambique, geochemical, geophysical and heat flow measurements were made to identify areas suitable for geothermal wells. One area lies next to the extinct Olkaria volcano, within the Hell’s Gate National Park, and sits over some of the thinnest continental crust on Earth.
This is a result of the thinning of the crust by tectonic stretching, causing hotter material below the Earth’s surface to rise, resulting in higher temperatures. This thin crust was ideal for the drilling of geothermal wells, reaching depths of around 3000 m, where temperatures get up to 342°C, far higher than the usual temperature of 90°C at this depth. Water in the surrounding rocks is converted to steam by the heat. The steam can be used to drive turbines and produce electricity.

160.Social networks. 社交网络  

Ten years ago, Barsky and Purdon( 2006) discovered that social networks which are expanding communication through social media are becoming popular and the costs involved are getting further reduced. Yet, library executives did not see how such a phenomenon could become a part of library and information services. They felt that the users should be left to their social media while the library carried on with its traditional roles( De Rosa et al., 2007). This was also the case when Charnigo and Barnett-Ellis( 2007) conducted a survey of 126 academic librarians and concluded that 54 of the librarians surveyed did not believe that there was an academic purpose for Facebook. The rationale behind these librarians belief was that social media was a space where students interact with each other, hence, the librarian was not welcome as their coming in might be viewed as an invasion of space. But time has proved that as the technology of social media became more popular, users and librarians acquired digital literacy, and libraries, seeing an explosion of social media around it, were forced to reconsider their stance. In a survey involving 497 international librarians, Taylor Francis( 2014) discovered that over 70 of librarians now feel that the use of social media is important. Though the wave began with public libraries( Mon, 2015), today, libraries of every type either have a social media presence or they are seriously considering it. Hence, the use of social media by libraries has become mainstream.

161.The Brundtland Report. 布伦特兰报告  

The Brundtland Report, Our Common Future( 1987), defines sustainable development as" development which meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs Implicit in this definition is the idea that the old pattern of development could not be sustained. Is this true? Development in the past was driven by growth and innovation. It led to new technologies and huge improvements in living standards. To assume that we know what the circumstances or needs of future generations will be is mistaken and inevitably leads to the debilitating sense that we are living on borrowed time.
Only if we assume that society will remain static can we understand the needs of the future. The way we live today could not have been predicted twenty years ago. The sustainability paradigm fails to recognize this. It is a static view and thus places limits on human ingenuity. Similarly, a whole host of false assumptions dominate environmental thought; the scale of problems is exaggerated, the amount of resources is underestimated and spurious links are made between areas such as green policies and profit, poverty and environmental degradation. Those of us who want a better future need to question these assumptions.

162.Assessment. 评估  

Assessment is a central process in education. If students learned what they were taught, we would never need to assess; we could instead just keep records of what we had taught. But as every teacher knows, many students do not learn what they are taught. Indeed, when we look at their work, it is sometimes hard to believe that they were in the classroom. In fact, it is impossible to predict with any certainty what students will learn as the result of a particular sequence of classroom activities. And because we cannot teach well without finding out where our students are starting from, we have to assess. Even if all our students started out at the same point( a highly unlikely situation!), each of them will have reached a different understanding of the material being studied within a very short period of time. That is why assessment is the bridge between teaching and learning it is only through assessment that we can find out whether what has happened in the classroom has produced the learning we intended.
Of course, assessment is also used for other purposes in education, which makes the picture much more complicated. In all countries, assessments of the performance of individual students are used to determine which students are, and which students are not, qualified for subsequent phases of education, and also to decide which kinds of education students should receive.

163.Upper Paleolithic people. 旧石器时代晚期人类  

The ways of life of Upper Paleolithic people are known through the remains of meals scattered around their hearths, together with many tools and weapons and the debris left over from their making. The people were hunter-gatherers who lived exclusively from what they could find in nature without practicing either agriculture or herding. They hunted the bigger herbivores, while berries, leaves, roots, wild fruit and mushrooms probably played a major role in their diet. Their hunting was indiscriminate, perhaps because so many animals were about that they did not need to spare pregnant females or the young. In the cave of Enlene, for example, many bones of reindeer and bison fetuses were found. Apparently, Upper Paleolithic people hunted like other predators and killed the weakest prey first. They did, however, sometimes concentrate on salmon runs and migrating herds of reindeer.
Contrary to popular beliefs about cavemen, Upper Paleolithic people did not live deep inside caves. They rather chose the foot of cliffs, especially when an overhang provided good shelter. On the plains and in the valleys, they used tents made from the hides of the animals they killed. At times, on the great Russian plains, they built huts with huge bones and tusks collected from the skeletons of mammoths.
Men hunted mostly with spears; the bow and arrow were probably not invented until the Magdalenian period that came at the end of the Upper Palaeolithic. Tools and weapons, made out of wood or reindeer antlers, often had flint cutting edges. Flint knappers were skillful and traditions in flint knapping were pursued for thousands of years. This continuity means that they must have been carefully taught how to find good flint nodules and how to knap them in order to make knives, burins( chisel-like tools) or scrapers, which could be used for various purposes.

165.Legume. 豆科植物  

Gardeners can feed their families and enrich the soil by growing legumes, such as green beans, soybeans, lentils and peas. Legume roots produce their own nitrogen, which is a major fertilizer nutrient needed by all plants for growth. Nitrogen is produced in nodules that form on the roots of legumes, which contain Rhizobium bacteria. The bacteria take nitrogen from the air and convert it into a form the plants can use. When legumes are pulled up in the fall, excess nitrogen from the nodules is left in the soil. The excess organic nitrogen can be used by other plants in following growing season. It's considered organic nitrogen because it was produced naturally, making green beans or peas great rotational crops in an organic crop production system. Organic growers prefer organic nitrogen because of its natural origins and because it breaks down slowly in the soil, thus slowly feeding plants throughout the growing season. Synthetic nitrogen fertilizers tend to release nitrogen quickly and are harsher on the environment. Synthetic nitrogen fertilizers are generally applied in split applications during the season to mimic the slow release of organic nitrogen sources. Each specific legume generally requires a specific type of Rhizobium bacteria to produce nodules on their roots. Gardeners who have never grown green beans before can purchase small bags of inoculum or bacteria from the most popular vegetable seed catalogs. Before planting beans, open the package and pour in the dust-like bacteria among the seeds. Shake the package and then plant. Nodules will form on the roots as they develop. The bacteria will remain in the soil, making it unnecessary to inoculate the seed next year. Do not apply extra nitrogen fertilizer to bean crops. Doing so makes bacteria in the nodules lazy, encouraging them to stop producing their own nitrogen. Legumes that are particularly popular in the home vegetable garden include lima beans, peas, edible soybeans, lentils and fava beans. In a recent survey, 44 percent of gardeners trained through New Mexico State University's Master Gardener Program said they grew green beans and other legumes in their home gardens. When planting, be sure to purchase appropriate strains of Rhizobium bacteria for each type of legume.

166.Leadership. 领导力  

A leader can define or clarify goals by issuing a memo or an executive order, an edict or a fatwa or a tweet, by passing a law, barking a command, or presenting an interesting idea in a meeting of colleagues. Leaders can mobilize people's energies in ways that range from subtle, quiet persuasion to coercive threats or the use of deadly force. Sometimes a charismatic leader such as Martin Luther King Jr. can define goals and mobilize energies through rhetoric and the power of example. We can think of leadership as a spectrum, in terms of both visibility and the power the leader wields. On one end of the spectrum, we have the most visible: authoritative leaders like the president of the United States or the prime minister of the United Kingdom, or a dictator such as Hitler or Qaddafi. At the opposite end of the spectrum is casual, low-key leadership found in countless situations every day around the world, leadership that can make a significant difference to the individuals whose lives are touched by it. Over the centuries, the first kind, the out-in-front, authoritative leadership, has generally been exhibited by men. Some men in positions of great authority, including Nelson Mandela, have chosen a strategy of" leading from behind more often, however, top leaders have been quite visible in their exercise of power. Women( as well as some men) have provided casual, low-key leadership behind the scenes. But this pattern has been changing, as more women have taken up opportunities for visible, authoritative leadership.

167.Dogs. 狗  

By living in close contact with humans, dogs have developed specific skills that enable them to interact and communicate effectively with people.
Recent studies have shown that the canine brain can pick up on emotional cues contained in a person's voice, body odor and posture, and read their faces. In this study, the authors observed what happened when they presented photographs of the same two adults faces, a man and a woman, to 26 feeding dogs. The images were placed strategically to the sides of the animals lives of sight and the photos showed a human face expressing one of the six basic human emotions: anger, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, disgust or being neutral.
The dogs showed greater response and cardiac activity when shown photographs that expressed arousing emotional states such as anger, fear and happiness. They also took longer to resume feeding after seeing these images. The dogs increased heart rate indicated that in these cases they experienced higher levels of stress. In addition, dogs turned their heads to the left when they saw human faces expressing anger, fear or happiness. The reverse happened when the faces looked surprised, possibly because dogs view it as a non-threatening, relaxed expression. These findings, therefore, support the existence of an asymmetrical emotional modulation of dogs brains to process basic human emotions.

168.Electric cars. 电动汽车  

Although we tend to think of electric cars as being something completely modern, they were in fact some of the earliest types of motorized vehicles.
At the beginning of the twentieth century, electric cars were actually more popular than cars with an internal combustion engine as they were more comfortable to ride in. However, as cars fuelled by petrol increased in importance, electric cars declined. The situation became such that electric vehicles were only used for certain specific purposes fork-lift trucks, ambulances and urban delivery vehicles, for example.
Although electricity declined in use in road vehicles, it steadily grew in importance as a means of powering trains. Switzerland, for example, was quick to develop an electrified train system, encouraged in this no doubt by the fact that it had no coal or oil resources of its own.
Nowadays there is renewed interest in electricity as a means of powering road vehicles. Why is this the case? Well, undoubtedly economic reasons are of considerable importance. The cost of oil has risen so sharply that there is a strong financial imperative to look for an alternative. However, there are also environmental motivations. Emissions from cars are blamed in large part for among other things the destruction of the ozone layer and the resultant rise in temperatures in the polar regions. A desire not to let things get any worse is also encouraging research into designing effective electric transport.

169.Bank overdraft. 银行透支  

Banks provide short-term finance to companies in the form of an overdraft on a current account. The advantage of an overdraft is its flexibility. When the cash needs of the company increase with seasonal factors, the company can continue to write cheques and watch the overdraft increase. When the goods and services are sold and cash begins to flow in, the company should be able to watch the overdraft decrease again. The most obvious example of a business that operates in this pattern is farming. The farmer uses the overdraft to finance the acquisition of seed for arable farming, or feed through the winter for stock farming and to cover the period when the crops or animals are growing and maturing. The overdraft is reduced when the crops or the animals are sold. The main disadvantage of an overdraft is that it is repayable on demand. The farmer whose crop fails because of bad weather knows the problem of being unable to repay the overdraft. Having overdraft financing increases the worries of those who manage the company. The other disadvantage is that the interest payable on overdrafts is variable. When interest rates increase, the cost of the overdraft increases. Furthermore, for small companies, there are often complaints that the rate of interest charged is high compared with that available to larger companies. The banks answer that the rates charged reflect relative risk and it is their experience that small companies are more risky.

170.Humans get little sleep. 人类睡眠不足  

If it seems like you're not getting enough sleep, you're not alone. People have evolved to sleep much less than chimps, baboons or any other primates studied so far, a new study finds. Charles Nunn and David Samson are evolutionary anthropologists. They study how humans have evolved to behave the way we do. Nunn works at Duke University in Durham, N. C. Samson works at the University of Toronto Mississauga in Canada. In their new study, the two compared sleep patterns in 30 different species of primates, including humans. Most species slept between nine and 15 hours daily. Humans averaged just seven hours of shut-eye. Based on lifestyle and biological factors, however, people should get 9. 55 hours, Nunn and Samson calculate. Most other primates in the study typically sleep as much as the scientists predicted they should. Nunn and Samson shared their findings on online February 14 in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology.

171.Work from home. 在家工作  

More people than ever now work from home for part or all of the week. Such flexibility can seem a good idea, but many people find it difficult to manage their time. Working from home in isolation can also prevent people from engaging in the daily interpersonal relationships that working life can offer which can help creativity and improve our mental well-being.
Time is our most precious commodity and a currency to spend. As my own research on lateness has highlighted, time management involves managing complex relationships and conflicts within ourselves as well as with others.
But when working from home, temptations abound which can eat up our time. Food is in the fridge or can be bought on a quick trip to the shops. Excitement of all kinds can be easily accessed through social media, websites or games which will arouse, enrage, shock, entertain, amuse or enthrall us. For some, the temptation to use their time badly, particularly online, can be very seductive. At any moment there is a delicate balance of power within: between our creative, constructive side and the side that seeks easier gratification and mindlessness.

172.Negotiation and compromise. 谈判与妥协  

Negotiation is a common process in business to mainly solve business conflicts between both parties. Compromise is a basic negotiation state in which both parties give up something that they want in order to get something else they want more. Compromise usually occurs in unfair parties when there is a fixed pie to be divided up, and whatever one side gets, the other side loses.
In compromise situations, neither side gets all of what they really want, but they each make concessions in order to reach an agreement that is acceptable to both. Both parties usually can reach a win-win concept through compromise. However, negotiation cannot resolve all the conflicts if one party is unwilling to resolve the problem.

176.Mugginess. 闷热  

What Makes It Muggy?
Like the heat index, muggy is a"feels-like" condition, except it has to do more with how"breathable" the air feels than how hot it feels. The muggier the weather, the less chance you'll feel cool because of decreased evaporation rates, which is why the following weather conditions are notoriously linked to the muggiest of days and nights:
Warm air temperatures, generally 70 F or above( the warmer the air, the more moisture it's able to hold);
High moisture( the more moisture there is in the air, the"heavier" it feels); and Low winds( the less wind there is, the fewer air molecules there are passing over your skin evaporating and cooling you off).
Since mugginess expresses how moist the air feels, you might think that relative humidity would be a good indicator of how muggy it feels outside. However, dew point temperature is actually a better measure of mugginess. Why? Dewpoint not only gives you an indication of how moist air is, but how warm it is as well( since dew point temperature can go as high as, but never higher than the actual air temperature). So if the dew point is high, it means both air moisture and temperature probably are, too.

177.Nature or nurture. 先天或后天  

When people start thinking about language, the first question that often occurs to them is this: is language natural to humans? in the same way that grunting is natural to pigs, and barking comes naturally to dogs. Or is it just something we happen to have learned? in the same way that dogs may learn to beg, or elephants may learn to waltz, or humans may learn to play the guitar.
Clearly, in one sense, children learn whatever language they are exposed to, be it Chinese, Nootka or English. So no one would deny that learning is very important. But the crucial question is whether children are born with blank sheets in their head as far as language is concerned or whether humans are programmed with an outline knowledge of the structure of languages in general.
This question of whether language is partly due to nature or wholly due to learning or nurture is often referred to as the nature-nurture controversy and has been discussed for centuries. For example, it was the topic of one of Plato's dialogues, the Cratylus. Controversies which have been going on for literally ages tend to behave in a characteristic fashion. They lie dormant for a while, then break out fiercely. This particular issue resurfaced in linguistics in 1959 when the linguist Noam Chomsky wrote a devastating and witty review of Verbal Behavior, a book by the Harvard psychologist B. F. Skinner( Skinner 1957; Chomsky 1959). This book claims to explain language as a set of habits gradually built up over the years. According to Skinner, no complicated innate or mental mechanisms are needed. All that is necessary is the systematic observation of the events in the external world which prompt the speaker to utter sounds.

178.Family therapist. 家庭治疗师  

As a family therapist, I often have the impulse to tell families to go home and have dinner together rather than spend an hour with me. And 20 years of research in North America, Europe, and Australia back up my enthusiasm for family dinners. It turns out that sitting down for a nightly meal is great for the brain, the body, and the spirit. And that nightly dinner doesn't have to be a gourmet meal that took three hours to cook, nor does it need to be made with organic arugula and heirloom parsnips. For starters, researchers found that for young children, dinnertime conversation boosts vocabulary even more than being read aloud. The researchers counted the number of rare words those not found on a list of 3, 000 most common words that the families used during dinner conversations. Young kids learned 1, 000 rare words at the dinner table, compared to only 143 from parents reading storybooks aloud. Kids who have a large vocabulary read earlier and more easily. Older children also reap intellectual benefits from family dinners. For school-age youngsters, regular mealtime is an even more powerful predictor of high achievement scores than time spent in school, doing homework, playing sports, or doing art. Other researchers reported a consistent association between family dinner frequency and teen academic performance. Adolescents who ate family meals 5 to 7 times a week were twice as likely to get an A in school as those who ate dinner with their families fewer than two times a week.

179.Straw building. 稻草建筑  

Many technologies have promised these qualities, but few have been commercially viable. What's been lacking is the performance data needed to demonstrate that these technologies are durable, genuinely environmentally beneficial, and suitable to be insured. Over the past 13 years, our Department of Architecture Civil Engineering has led on research into straw as a low-impact building material. This work, which has included developing a unique straw bale panel as well as scientific monitoring and testing, has now culminated in crucial industry certifications. The BM TRADA's Q-Mark certification guarantees a straw building's energy efficiency, fire safety, durability and weather-resilience and means that developers and homebuyers can now get insurance and mortgages for straw homes and buildings. The innovative straw walls in the new houses provide two times more insulation than required by current UK building regulations. Based on monitoring a residential straw-bale development in Leeds, fuel bill reductions of up to 90 can be expected. The walls have been built using ModCell technology; prefabricated panels consisting of a wooden structural frame infilled with straw bales or hemp and rendered with either a breathable lime-based system or ventilated timber or brick cladding. This technology combines the lowest carbon footprint and the best operational carbon dioxide; performance of any system of construction currently available. In fact, as an agricultural co-product, straw buildings can be carbon-negative as straw absorbs carbon dioxide; when it grows.

180.Prior knowledge. 先前知识  

What is known( prior knowledge or pre-existing knowledge) is the knowledge, skill or ability that a learner brings to a new learning encounter. This includes all knowledge that is available before the learning event, and which has been gathered or developed by any means, and in any situation, including both formal and, quite often, informal learning situations. Learners need enough previous knowledge and understanding to enable them to learn new things; they also need help making links with new and previous knowledge explicit.
It is considered to be valuable to go through a process of what has been called activating prior knowledge. Teachers often go through this process at the beginning of a new topic. They also use introductory strategies at the beginning of lessons which are continuations from previous lessons. In terms of the practicalities of teaching, this is a process of making children think about the topic or remember what has been covered already. In terms of theory, it has to do with activating particular schemas.

181.Rosling's discoveries. 罗斯林的发现  

A medical doctor and professor of international health at Stockholm's Karolinska Institute, Rosling became famous as a public educator who used statistics to show how the world is changing.
He chose this public role after making two significant discoveries.
Rosling's first discovery was that many people are not aware of even the most basic facts about global health and global development. Through surveys he conducted, Rosling found that at a time when poverty is falling faster than ever before, the majority of people think that the proportion of the world population living in extreme poverty is rising. Similarly, he found that many underestimate global life expectancy widely, and are not aware of the success of delivering healthcare services for example, vaccines globally. He found that people's worldviews often do not have much grounding in facts, even long before the post-fact era.
Rosling was convinced that this unawareness of global progress matters.
He made it his mission to fight this"devastating ignorance" that turns us into cynics, as we falsely believe that global development must be a mirage.
Rosling's second discovery was that this lack of factual knowledge was not because people are not interested in global development, but because it is too hard for those that want to know about global development to access this knowledge. Neither the experts nor the media were presenting how global development changes the world.
Based on these two insights, Hans Rosling made it his mission to bridge this gap and present the evidence that global development is a reality.
His approach to communicating research on global development was through public talks and the use of data visualization.

182.Near-infrared wavelengths. 近红外波长  

The colors that we see are a result of the light reflected within a narrow range of wavelengths what we call the visible spectrum. But sunlight also spans wavelengths that we cannot see.
Humans can't see ultraviolet wavelengths, which many other animals can see.
But there's one set of wavelengths that elude all of us these are near-infrared( NIR) wavelengths. And understanding how bird feathers interact with these wavelengths is important, not just for birds, but also for humans through the potential for improvements in thermal efficiency.
Our research in the School of BioSciences at the University of Melbourne suggests that some Australian birds can control their temperature and avoid overheating by reflecting near-infrared wavelengths of sunlight.
We collected information on 90 species of Australian birds and found a very strong link between living in hot, arid regions and reflecting a higher proportion of near-infrared light.
Researchers in the field of animal coloration have largely ignored near-infrared light because it isn't easy to measure and there's no evidence that animals can see these wavelengths.
Because these wavelengths are invisible, they don't affect camouflage or sexual attractiveness, which are very important in the animal world. This means that many animals can control their temperature by altering the reflection of near-infrared light without compromising their ability to hide or attract a mate.

The colours that we see are a result of the light reflected within a narrow range of wavelengths, but sunlight also spans wavelengths that we cannot see, while many other animals can see, and one set of wavelengths that elude all of use are near-infrared wavelengths, which are found to be used by animals to control their temperature and to avoid overheating, and they don't affect camouflage or sexual attractiveness since these wavelengths are invisible.

183.Khoikhoi. 科伊科伊人  

The area that is now South Africa has been inhabited by humans for millennia. The San, the original inhabitants of this land, were migratory people who lived in small groups of about 15 to 20 people. They survived by fishing and hunting and by gathering roots and other wild foods. They did not build permanent dwellings but used rock shelters as temporary dwellings. Around 2, 000 years ago Khoikhoi pastoralists migrated to the coast. In the eastern part of present-day South Africa, iron-working societies date from about 300 AD. The Sotho-Tswana and Nguni peoples arrived in this region around 1, 200 AD. They lived by agriculture and stock farming, mined gold, copper and tin hunted for ivory and built stone-walled towns. Over the centuries, these societies had diverse contacts with the Khoisan. Strife between the San and the Khoikhoi developed over competition for the game; eventually, the Khoikhoi became dominant. These peoples lived in the western part of present-day South Africa and are known collectively as the Khoisan.

184.Women educational degree. 女性教育程度  

If women are so far ahead of men, why are they so far behind? Reports from both sides of the Atlantic show that female students dominate university courses, yet women still do not make it to the top. A report on inequality in the UK said last week that girls had better educational results than boys at 16, went to university in greater numbers and achieved better degrees once they got there."More women now have higher education qualifications than men in every age group up to age 44," the report said. In the US, 57 percent of college graduates in 2006 07 were women. Women form the majority of all graduates under 45.
Yet few women make it to the boards of companies in either country. In the UK, the proportion of women on FTSE 100 boards rose fractionally from 11. 7 percent to 12. 2 percent last year, according to the Cranfield University School of Management, but that was only because of a fall in the size of the boards. In the US, women accounted for 15. 2 percent of board seats in Fortune 500 companies, according to Catalyst, the research organization, which said the numbers had barely budged for five years. The hopeful way of looking at this is that the rising generation of female graduates has yet to reach the director age. Give it 10 years and they will dominate boards as they do universities. If that were true, however, we would surely see the number of female directors numbers moving up by now. The first year that female college graduates outnumbered men in the US was 1982. These graduates must be entering their 50s prime director age.

185.Fallacy. 谬误  

When we form arguments or examine others’ arguments, we need to be cognizant of possible fallacies. A fallacy can be defined as a flaw or error in reasoning. At its most basic, a logical fallacy refers to a defect in the reasoning of an argument that causes the conclusion(s) to be invalid, unsound, or weak. The existence of a fallacy in a deductive argument makes the entire argument invalid. The existence of a fallacy in an inductive argument weakens the argument but does not invalidate it.
It is important to study fallacies so you can avoid them in the arguments you make. Studying fallacies also provides you with a foundation for evaluating and critiquing other arguments as well. Once you start studying and thinking about fallacies, you’ll find they are everywhere. You could say that we live in a fallacious world!
The study of fallacies can be dated back to the start of the study of logic. In ancient Greece, Aristotle classified fallacies into two categories—linguistic and non-linguistic. Within these two categories, he identified 13 individual fallacies. Through time we have reclassified fallacies using various typologies and criteria. For our purposes, we will focus on formal and informal fallacies.

186.Positive mind set. 积极心态  

Research shows that when people work with a positive mindset, performance on nearly every level productivity, creativity, engagement improves. Yet happiness is perhaps the most misunderstood driver of performance. For one, most people believe that success precedes happiness. Once I get a promotion, I'll be happy, they think. Or, Once I hit my sales target, I'll feel great. But because success is a moving target as soon as you hit your target, you raise it again the happiness that results from success is fleeting. In fact, it works the other way around: People who cultivate a positive mindset perform better in the face of challenges. I call this the happiness advantage every business outcome shows improvement when the brain is positive. I've observed this effect in my role as a researcher and lecturer in 48 countries on the connection between employee happiness and success. And I'm not alone: In a meta-analysis of 225 academic studies, researchers Sonja Lyubomirsky, Laura King, and Ed Diener found strong evidence of directional causality between life satisfaction and successful business outcomes. Another common misconception is that our genetics, our environment, or a combination of the two determines how happy we are. To be sure, both factors have an impact. But one's general sense of well-being is surprisingly malleable. The habits you cultivate, the way you interact with co-workers, how you think about stress all these can be managed to increase your happiness and your chances of success.

187.Brain waves. 脑电波  

We can't see it, but brains hum with electrical activity. Brain waves are created by the coordinated firing of huge collections of nerve cells pinball around the brain. The waves can ricochet from the front of the brain to the back, or from deep structures all the way to the scalp and then back again.
Called neuronal oscillations, these signals are known to accompany certain mental states. Quiet alpha waves ripple soothingly across the brains of meditating monks. Beta waves rise and fall during intense conversational turns. Fast gamma waves accompany sharp insights. Sluggish delta rhythms lull deep sleepers, while dreamers shift into slightly quicker theta rhythms.
Researchers have long argued over whether these waves have a purpose, and what those purposes might be. Some scientists see waves as inevitable but useless by-products of the signals that really matter messages sent by individual nerve cells. Waves are simply a consequence of collective neural behavior, and nothing more, that view holds. But a growing body of evidence suggests just the opposite: Instead of by-products of important signals, brain waves are key to how the brain operates, routing information among far-flung brain regions that need to work together.
MIT's Earl Miller is among the neuroscientists amassing evidence that waves are an essential part of how the brain operates. Brain oscillations deftly route information in a way that allows the brain to choose which signals in the world to pay attention to and which to ignore, his recent studies suggest.
Other research supports this view, too. Studies on people with electrodes implanted in their brains suggest brain waves, and their interactions, help enable emotion, language, vision and more.

188.Traits of human. 人类特征  

The age-old question of whether human traits are determined by nature or nurture has been answered, a team of researchers say. Their conclusion? It's a draw. By collating almost every twin study across the world from the past 50 years, researchers determined that the average variation for human traits and disease is 49 percent due to genetic factors and 51 percent due to environmental factors.
University of Queensland researcher Beben Benyamin from the Queensland Brain Institute collaborated with researchers at VU University of Amsterdam to collate 2, 748 studies involving more than 14. 5 million pairs of twins. Twin studies have been conducted for more than 50 years but there is still some debate in terms of how much the variation is due to genetic or environmental factors, Benyamin said.
He said the study showed the conversation should move away from nature versus nurture, instead looking at how the two work together. Both are important sources of variation between individuals, he said. While the studies averaged an almost even split between nature and nurture, there was wide variation within the 17, 800 separate traits and diseases examined by the studies. For example, the risk for bipolar disorder was found to be 68 percent due to genetics and only 32 percent due to environmental factors. Weight maintenance was 63 percent due to genetics and 37 percent due to environmental factors. In contrast, risk for eating disorders was found to be 40 percent genetic and 60 percent environmental, whereas the risk for mental and behavioral disorders due to use of alcohol was 41 percent genetic and 59 percent environmental.
Benyamin said in psychiatric, ophthalmological and skeletal traits, genetic factors were a larger influence than environmental factors. But for social values and attitudes it was the other way around

189.Museology. 博物馆学  

What is museology? A simple definition might be that it is the study of museums, their history and underlying philosophy, the various ways in which they have, in the course of time, been established and developed, their avowed or unspoken aims and policies, and their educative or political or social role. More broadly conceived, such a study might also embrace the bewildering variety of audiences visitors, scholars, art lovers, children at whom the efforts of museum staff are supposedly directed, as well as related topics such as the legal duties and responsibilities placed upon( or incurred by) museums, perhaps even some thought as to their future. Seen in this light, museology might appear at first sight a subject so specialized as to concern only museum professionals, who by their occupation are more or less obliged to take an interest in it. In reality, since museums are almost, if not quite as old as civilization itself, and since the plethora of present-day museums embraces virtually every field of human endeavor not just art, or craft, or science, but entertainment, agriculture, rural life, childhood, fisheries, antiquities, automobiles: the list is endless it is a field of inquiry so broad as to be a matter of concern to almost everybody.

190.Orbital Debris. 轨道碎片  

For decades, space experts have worried that a speeding bit of orbital debris might one day smash a large spacecraft into hundreds of pieces and start a chain reaction, a slow cascade of collisions that would expand for centuries, spreading chaos through the heavens.
In the last decade or so, as scientists came to agree that the number of objects in orbit had surpassed a critical mass or, in their terms, the critical spatial density, the point at which a chain reaction becomes inevitable they grew more anxious.
Early this year, after a half-century of growth, the federal list of detectable objects( four inches wide or larger) reached 10, 000, including dead satellites, spent rocket stages, a camera, a hand tool and junkyards of whirling debris left over from chance explosions and destructive tests. So our billion dollar of satellites are at risk.

191.The Two Cultures. 两种文化  

C. P. Snow's essay"The Two Cultures" addressed the division between literary intellectuals and scientists in society. He argued that this divide hindered intellectual engagement with important issues and called for a balanced education that valued both humanities and sciences.
Snow emphasized the importance of scientific literacy for intellectuals, as it allows for a deeper understanding of complex challenges such as population growth, climate change, and technological advancements. Without this knowledge, intellectuals may struggle to effectively address these issues.
Despite his focus on scientific literacy, Snow recognized the value of the humanities. He believed that a harmonious integration of both cultures was necessary for societal progress. By combining the humanities and sciences in education, individuals would be equipped with the skills needed to tackle global problems.
Beyond academics, Snow also acknowledged the wider social and economic implications of the cultural divide. He argued that an overemphasis on literary education contributed to a social class divide, limiting opportunities for those without a scientific background. To address this inequality, Snow advocated for a more equal distribution of educational resources.
Today, Snow's perspectives remain relevant as specialization in various fields further widens the gap between scientists and literary intellectuals. Collaboration across disciplines is crucial for addressing complex global challenges. A balanced education that incorporates both the humanities and sciences is essential for developing individuals who can effectively navigate these challenges.
In conclusion, C. P. Snow's essay shed light on the division between two cultures literary and scientific and the challenges it poses. His emphasis on scientific literacy, while recognizing the value of the humanities, is still applicable today. By bridging this gap and promoting interdisciplinary collaboration, we can gain a comprehensive understanding of the world and effectively address complex societal issues.

193.Benefit of Honey. 蜂蜜的好处  

In order to have a competitive edge, athletes often use drugs with high athletic performance.
The National Honey Board recently found that honey has the same functions but less negative impact. This clinical trial is the third in a series of studies focusing on the use of honey by athletes. The first study( involving 71 subjects) determined that honey has a milder effect on blood sugar than other popular forms of carbohydrate gel.
The second study in the series( with 39 weight trained subjects) investigated the combination of honey with a protein supplement and suggested that honey speeds muscle recovery after a workout.

195.Immune System. 免疫系统  

What is the Immune System?
The immune system is a complex network of different organs, cells, and proteins that work together.
There are 2 main parts of the immune system: the innate immune system that you are born with, and the adaptive immune system that you develop when your body is exposed to microbes or chemicals released by microbes. These two immune systems work together.
The Innate Immune System
This is your child's rapid response system. It is the first to respond when it finds an invader. It is made up of the skin, the eye's cornea, and the mucous membrane that lines the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tracts. These all create physical barriers to help protect your child's body. They protect against harmful germs, parasites( such as worms), or cells( such as cancer). The innate immune system is inherited. It is active from the moment your child is born. When this system recognizes an invader, it goes into action right away. The cells of this immune system surround and cover the invader. The invader is killed inside the immune system cells( called phagocytes).
The Acquired Immune System
The acquired immune system, with help from the innate system, makes special proteins( called antibodies) to protect your body from a specific invader. These antibodies are developed by cells called B lymphocytes after the body has been exposed to the invader. The antibodies stay in your child's body. It can take several days for antibodies to form. But after the first exposure, the immune system will recognize the invader and defend against it. The acquired immune system changes during your child's life. Immunizations train your child's immune system to make antibodies to protect them from harmful diseases.

196.Differences in intelligence. 智力差异  

People differ greatly in all aspects of what is casually known as intelligence. The differences are apparent not only in school, from kindergarten to college, but also in the most ordinary circumstances: in the words people use and comprehend, in their differing abilities to read a map or follow directions, or in their capacities for remembering telephone numbers or figuring change. The variations in these specific skills are so common that they are often taken for granted.
Yet what makes people so different? It would be reasonable to think that the environment is the source of differences in cognitive skills that we are what we learn. It is clear, for example, that human beings are not born with a full vocabulary; they have to learn words. Hence, learning must be the mechanism by which differences in vocabulary arise among individuals. And differences in experience say, in the extent to which parents model and encourage vocabulary skills or in the quality of language training provided by schools must be responsible for individual differences in learning.
Earlier in this century, psychology was in fact dominated by environmental explanations for variance in cognitive abilities. More recently, however, most psychologists have begun to embrace a more balanced view: one in which nature and nurture interact in cognitive development. During the past few decades, studies in genetics have pointed to a substantial role for heredity in molding the components of intellect, and researchers have even begun to track down the genes involved in cognitive function. These findings do not refute the notion that environmental factors shape the learning process. Instead, they suggest that differences in people's genes affect how easily they learn.

198.Product Life Cycle. 产品生命周期

The product life cycle has 4 very clearly defined stages, each with its characteristics that mean different things for businesses that are trying to manage the life cycle of their particular products.
Introduction Stage This stage of the cycle could be the most expensive for a company launching a new product. The size of the market for the product is small, which means sales are low, although they will be increasing. On the other hand, the cost of things like research and development, consumer testing, and the marketing needed to launch the product can be very high, especially if it's a competitive sector.
Growth Stage The growth stage is typically characterized by strong growth in sales and profits, and because the company can start to benefit from economies of scale in production, the profit margins, as well as the overall amount of profit, will increase. This makes it possible for businesses to invest more money in promotional activity to maximize the potential of this growth stage.
Maturity Stage During the maturity stage, the product is established and the aim for the manufacturer is now to maintain the market share they have built up. This is probably the most competitive time for most products and businesses need to invest wisely in any marketing they undertake. They also need to consider any product modifications or improvements to the production process which might give them a competitive advantage.
Decline Stage Eventually, the market for a product will start to shrink, and this is what's known as the decline stage. This shrinkage could be due to the market becoming saturated( i. e. all the customers who will buy the product have already purchased it), or because the consumers are switching to a different type of product. While this decline may be inevitable, it may still be possible for companies to make some profit by switching to less-expensive production methods and cheaper markets.
